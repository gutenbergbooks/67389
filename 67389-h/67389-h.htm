<h5 class='c019'><i>Chronological Epochs in the Formation of the British Museum.</i></h5>

<p class='c020'>In two particulars, more especially, our great National
Museum stands distinguished among institutions of its
kind. The collections which compose it extend over a
wider range than that covered by any other public establishment
having a like purpose. And, if we take them as
a whole, those collections are also far more conspicuously
indebted to the liberality of individual benefactors.  <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Public debt to private Collectors.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In a
degree of which there is elsewhere no example, the British
Museum has been gradually built up by the munificence
of open-handed Collectors, rather than by the public means
of the Nation, as administered by Parliament, or by the
Governments of the day.</p>

<p class='c021'>The real founders of our British Museum have been neither
our British monarchs nor our British legislators, as such.
They have been, commonly, individual and private British
subjects; men loyal both to the Crown and to the People.
Often, they have been men standing in direct lineal descent
from the great Barons who dictated the Charter of our
liberties, in the meadow near Windsor, and from those
who led English knights and English bowmen to victory,
on the wooded slopes near Poitiers. Sometimes, they have
been men of very lowly birth; such as could point to no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>ancestral names appended to <i>Magna Charta</i>, or to the
famous letter written from Lincoln to Boniface the Eighth;
such as may, indeed, very well have had ancestors who
gave their lives, or their limbs, for England at Poitiers or
at Cressy, but who certainly could point to no heraldic
memorials of feats of arms done on those bloody fields of
France. Not a few of them, perhaps, would have been
vainly asked to tell the names of their grandfathers. One
boast, however, is common to both of these groups of our
public benefactors. They were men who had alike a
strong sense of gratitude to those who had gone before
them, and a strong sense of duty to those who were to
come after them. To nearly all of the men whose lives
will be told in this volume are applicable, in a special
sense, some words of Julius <span class='sc'>Hare</span>:—‘They wrought in a
magnanimous spirit of rivalry with Nature, or in kindly
fellowship with her.... <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>J. &amp; A. Hare, <i>Guesses at Truth</i>, vol. ii, p. 18.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When they planted, they chose
out the trees of longest life—the Oak, the Chestnut, the
Yew, the Elm,—trees which it does us good to behold,
while we muse on the many generations of our Forefathers,
whose eyes have reposed within the same leafy bays.’ They
were men whose large impulses and deep insight led them
to work, less for themselves than for their successors. It
is by dint of what men of that stamp did—and did, not
under the leading of the Gospel according to Adam <span class='sc'>Smith</span>,
but of a Gospel very much older than it—that upon us,
whose day is now passing, Posterity, so to speak, ‘has
cast her shadow before; and we are, at this moment,
reposing beneath it.’ Of Public Benefactions, such as those
which this volume very inadequately commemorates, it is
true, with more than ordinary truth, that we owe them,
mainly, to a generous conviction in the hearts of certain
worthies of old days that they owed suit and service to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Posterity. This may, indeed, be said of public foresight,
when evidenced in material works and in provisions to
smooth some of the asperities of common life and of manual
toil. But it may be said, more appropriately still, of another
and a higher kind of public foresight;—of that evidenced
in educational institutions, and in the various appliances for
raising and vivifying the common intellect; for enlarging
its faculties; diffusing its enjoyments; and broadening
its <i>public</i> domain. As it has been said (by the same
acute thinker who has just been quoted) in better words
than any of mine:—‘The great works that were wrought
by men of former times; the great fabrics that were raised
by them; their mounds and embankments against the
powers of evil; their drains to carry off mischief; the wide
fields they redeemed from the overflowings of barbarism;
the countless fields they enclosed and husbanded for good
to grow and thrive in;&#160;... all this they [mainly] achieved
<i>for Posterity</i>....
 <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>J. &amp; A. Hare,
<i>Guesses at
Truth</i>, vol. ii,
p. 13.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Except for Posterity; except for the
vital magnetic consciousness that while men perish, Man
survives, the only principle of prudent conduct must
have been, “<i>Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we
die</i>.”’</p>

<p class='c009'>The pages which follow have been written in the belief
that they afford—whatever the defects of their Writer—useful
illustrations of this great and pregnant truth. To
him it has not been given to work ‘<i>for Posterity</i>,’ otherwise
than as a Chronicler of some of the workings of other men.
But he owns to a special delight in that humble function.
Its charm,—to his mind,—is enhanced, on the present occasion,
by the very fact that so much of the work now about
to be narrated is the work of men who only rarely have
been labouring with other means, or with other implements,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>than those which were personal to themselves, as
individuals.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the chief countries of the Continent of Europe—on
the other hand—great national Museums have, commonly,
had their origin in the liberality and wise foresight either
of some sovereign or other, or of some powerful minister
whose mind was large enough to combine with the cares
of State a care for Learning. In Britain, our chief public
collection of literature and of science originated simply in
the public spirit of private persons.</p>

<p class='c009'>The <span class='sc'>British Museum</span> was founded precisely at that
period of our history when the distinctively national, or
governmental, care for the interests of literature and of
science was at its lowest, or almost its lowest, point. As
regards the monarchs, it would be hard to fix on any, since
the dawn of the Revival of Learning, who evinced less
concern for the progress and diffusion of learning than did
the first and second princes of the House of Hanover. As
regards Parliament, the tardy and languid acceptance of
the boon proffered, posthumously, by Sir Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>,
constitutes just the one exceptional act of encouragement
that serves to give saliency to the utter indifference which
formed the ordinary rule.</p>

<p class='c021'>Long before <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>’s time (as we shall see hereafter),
there had been zealous and repeated efforts to arouse the
attention of the Government as well to the political importance
as to the educational value of public museums.
Many thinkers had already perceived that such collections
were a positive increase of public wealth and of national
greatness, as well as a powerful instrument of popular
education. It had been shewn, over and over again, that
for lack of public care precious monuments and treasures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>of learning had been lost; sometimes by their removal to
far-off countries; sometimes by their utter destruction.
Until the appeal made to Parliament by the Executors of
Sir Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, in the middle of the eighteenth century,
all those efforts had uniformly failed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The real Founders of the British Museum.</span></div>

<p class='c021'>But Sir Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> cannot claim to be regarded, individually
or very specially, as the Founder of the British
Museum. His last Will, indeed, gave an opportunity for
the foundation. Strictly speaking, he was not even the
Founder of his own Collection, as it stood in his lifetime.
The Founder of the Sloane Museum was William <span class='sc'>Courten</span>,
the last of a line of wealthy Flemish refugees, whose
history, in their adopted country, is a series of romantic
adventures.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The acquisition, by the Nation, of the Cotton Library.</span></div>

<p class='c021'>Parliament had previously accepted the gift of the
Cottonian Library, at the hands of Sir John <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, third
in descent from its Founder, and its acceptance of that gift
had been followed by almost unbroken neglect, although
the gift was a noble one.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>(T. Carte to Sir Thomas Hanmer, Speaker of the House of Commons; <i>Hanmer Corresp.</i>, p. 226.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Sir John, when conversing, on
one occasion, with Thomas <span class='sc'>Carte</span>, told the historian that
he had been offered £60,000 of English money, together
with a <i>carte blanche</i> for some honorary mark of royal
favour, on the part of <span class='sc'>Lewis the Fourteenth</span>, for the
Library which he afterwards settled upon the British
nation. It has been estimated that <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> expended
(from first to last) upon his various collections about
£50,000; so that, even from the mercantile point of view,
the <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> family may be said to have been larger voluntary
contributors towards our eventual National Museum
than was Sir Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> himself. That point of view,
however, would be a very false, because very narrow, one.</p>

<p class='c021'>Whether estimated by mere money value, or by a truer
standard, the third, in order of time, of the Foundation-Collections, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>of the ‘Harleian Manuscripts,’—was a
much less important acquisition for the Nation than was
the Museum of <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, or the Library of <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>; but
its literary value, as all students of our history and literature
know, is, nevertheless, considerable. Its first Collector,
Robert <span class='sc'>Harley</span>, the Minister of Queen Anne and the first
of the Harleian Earls of Oxford, is fairly entitled to rank,
after <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, <span class='sc'>Courten</span>, and <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, among the virtual
or eventual co-founders of the British Museum.</p>

<p class='c009'>Chronologically, then, Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, William
<span class='sc'>Courten</span>, Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, and Robert <span class='sc'>Harley</span>, rank first
as Founders; so long as we estimate their relative position
in accordance with the successive steps by which the
British Museum was eventually organized. But there is
another synchronism by which greater accuracy is attainable.
Although four years had elapsed between the
passing—in 1753—of ‘<i>An Act for the purchase of the
Museum or Collection of Sir Hans Sloane, and of the
Harleian Collection of Manuscripts, and for providing one
general repository for the better reception and more convenient
use of the said Collection, and of the Cottonian
Library and of the additions thereto</i>,’ and the gift—in 1757—to
the Trustees of those already united
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Old Royal Library</span>, formed by <span class='sc'>Prince Henry</span> (son of James I) at St. James’.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Collections by
King <span class='sc'>George the Second</span>, of the Old Royal Library of
the Kings his predecessors, yet that royal collection itself
had been (in a restricted sense of the words) a Public and
National possession soon after the days of the first real and
central Founder of the present Museum, Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>.
But, despite its title, that Royal Library, also, was—in
the main—the creation of subjects, not of Sovereigns or
Governments. Its virtual founder was <span class='sc'>Henry</span>, Prince of
Wales. It was acquired, out of his privy purse, as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>subject, not as a Prince. He, therefore, has a title to be
placed among the individual Collectors whose united efforts
resulted—after long intervals of time—in the creation,
eventually, of a public institution second to none, of its
kind, in the world.</p>

<p class='c021'>Prince <span class='sc'>Henry</span>’s story is not the least curious of the
many life-stories which these pages have to tell. That
small span of barely eighteen years was eventful, as well
as full of promise. And it may very fitly be told next, in
order, after that of <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, who was not only his contemporary
but his friend.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The MSS. of Lord Arundel.</span></div>

<p class='c021'>As the Royal Library was, in a certain degree, a Public
Collection before the foundation of the Museum, so also
was the Arundelian Library of Manuscripts. It did not
become part of the British Museum until nearly eighty
years after the amalgamation of the Cottonian, Harleian,
Sloanian, and Royal Collections into one integral body.
But the munificent Earl who formed it had often made
it public, for the use of scholars, in his own lifetime.
One or two of his descendants allowed it to fall into
neglect. Before it left old Arundel House, in the Strand,
it was exposed, more than once, to loss by petty thefts.
But when, by another descendant, the injury was repaired,
and the still choice collection given—at the earnest entreaty
of another of our English worthies, John <span class='sc'>Evelyn</span>—to the
Royal Society, the Arundelian MSS., like the Library at
Saint James’ Palace, became (so far as a circle of literary
men and of the cultivators of scientific inquiry were concerned)
a public possession. Many of the Arundelian
marbles had also become—by other acts of munificence
worthy of the time-honoured name of <span class='sc'>Howard</span>—to the
Public at large, and without restriction, ‘things of beauty,’
and ‘joys for ever.’ Others of them, indeed, are—even in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>these days—shut up at Wilton with somewhat of a narrow
jealousy of the undistinguished multitude. But, by the
liberality of the Dukes of <span class='sc'>Marlborough</span>, the choice gems
gathered by the Earl of <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> during his long travels
on the Continent, and his widespread researches throughout
the world, have long been made available to public
enjoyment, in more ways than one. The varied narrative
of that famous Collector’s life may, perhaps, not unfitly be
placed next after that of the best of the Stuart princes.
<span class='sc'>Arundel</span>, like <span class='sc'>Henry</span>, was the friend of Sir Robert
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, and was proud of that distinction.</p>

<p class='c009'>Undoubtedly, there is more than one point of view from
which we may regard the preponderating share borne by
private collectors in the ultimate creation of our national
repository as matter of satisfaction, rather than matter of
shame. It testifies to the strength amongst us—even at times
deeply tinged with civil discord—of public and patriotic
feeling. Nor is this all. It testifies, negatively, but not
less strongly, to a conscientious sense of responsibility, on
the part of those who have administered British rule in
conquered countries, and in remote dependencies of the
Crown. Few readers of such a book as this are likely to
be altogether unacquainted with national museums and
national libraries which have been largely enriched by the
strong hand of the spoiler. Into some such collections it
is impossible for portions of the people at whose aggregate
expense they are maintained to enter, without occasional
feelings of disgust and humiliation. There are, it is true,
a few trophies of successful war in our own Museum.
But there is nothing in its vast stores which, to any visitor
of any nationality whatever, can bring back memories of
ruthless and insolent spoliation.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>That narrowness of conception, however, which has made
some publicists to regard the slenderness of the contributions
of the Nation at large, when contrasted with the extent of
those of individuals, as if it were a cause for boasting, is
visibly, and very happily, on the decline. It is coming to
be recognised, more implicitly with every year that passes,
that whatever can be done by the action of Parliament, or
of the Government, for the real promotion of public
civilisation,—in the amplest and deepest meaning of that
word,—is but the doing of the People themselves, by the
use of the most effective machinery they have at hand;
rather than the acceptance of a boon conferred upon them,
extraneously and from above.</p>

<p class='c009'>If that salient characteristic in the past history of our
<span class='sc'>British Museum</span> is very far from affording any legitimate
cause of boasting to the publicist, it affords an undeniable
advantage to the narrator of the history itself. It not only
broadens the range of his subject, by placing at its threshold
the narrative of several careers which will be found to
combine, at times, romantic adventure and political intrigue
with public service of a high order; but it binds up,
inseparably, the story of the quiet growth of an institution
in London with occasional glimpses at the progress,
from age to age, of geographical and scientific discovery, of
archæological exploration, and of the most varied labours
for the growth of human learning, throughout the world.</p>

<p class='c021'>As an organized establishment, the <span class='sc'>British Museum</span>
is but little more than a century old. The history of its
component parts extends over three centuries. That
history embraces a series of systematic researches,—scientific,
literary, and archæological,—the account of which
(whatsoever the needful brevity of its treatment in these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>pages) must be told clumsily, indeed, if it be found to
lack a very wide and general interest for all classes of
readers—one class only excepted.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The diversity of the Museum Collections.</span></div>

<p class='c021'>Even the least thoughtful among those visitors who can
be said to frequent the Museum—as distinguished from
the mere holiday guests, who come only in crowds, little
favourable to vision; to say nothing of thought—will
occasionally have had some faint impression or other of the
great diversity and wonderful combination of effort which
must have been employed in bringing together the Collections
they look upon. Every part and almost every age
of the world has contributed something; and that something
includes the most characteristic productions and
choicest possessions of every part. Almost every man of
British birth who,—during many centuries,—has won
conspicuous fame as a traveller, as an archæologist, or as
a discoverer, has helped, in one way or other, to enrich
those collections. They bear their own peculiar testimony
to nearly every step which has been taken either in the
maritime and colonial enterprise, or in the political growth,
of the British empire. Nor is their testimony a whit less
cogent to the power of that feeling of international brotherhood,
in matters of learning and science, which grows with
their growth, and waxes stronger with their strength.</p>

<p class='c009'>To the remarkable career of the first of those four
primary Collectors, whose lifelong pursuits converged,
eventually, in the foundation of an institution, of the full
scope of which only one of the four had even a mental
glimpse—and <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>’s glimpse was obviously but a
very dim one—the attention of the reader has now to be
turned. Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>’s employments in political
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>life (unofficial as they were), and the powerful influence
which he exerted upon statesmen much abler than himself,
will be found, it is hoped, to give not a little of historical
interest to his biography, quite additional to that which
belongs to his pursuits as a studious Collector, and as the
most famous of all the literary antiquaries who occur throughout
our English story.</p>

<p class='c021'>To the conspicuous merits which belong to Sir Robert
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span> as a politician of no mean acumen, and as,—in
the event,—the real Founder of the British Museum, are
added the still higher distinctions of an eminently generous
spirit and a faithful heart. His openhandedness in giving
was constant and princely. His firmness in friendship is
testified by the fact that although (in a certain point of view)
he was the courtier both of <span class='sc'>James the First</span> and of <span class='sc'>Charles
the First</span>, he nevertheless stood persistently and unflinchingly
by the side of <span class='sc'>Eliot</span>, and of the men who worked
with <span class='sc'>Eliot</span>, in the period of their deepest court disgrace.
By the best of the Parliamentarian leaders he was both
reverenced and loved. And he reciprocated their feeling.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Recent attacks on Sir Robert Cotton’s memory.</span></div>

<p class='c021'>My personal pleasure in the task of writing the life of
such a man as he was is much enhanced by a strong
conviction that certain recent attacks upon his memory
are based upon fallacious evidence, shallow presumptions,
and hasty judgments. It is my hope to be able to shew
to the Reader, conclusively, that <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> was worthy of
the cordial regard and the high esteem in which he was
uniformly held by men who stood free of all bias from
political and party connexion—such, for example, as
William <span class='sc'>Camden</span>, who spoke of him, almost with dying
lips, as ‘the dearest of all my friends,’—as well as by those
great Parliamentarian leaders whose estimate of him may,
perhaps, be thought—by hasty readers—to rest partly, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>not mainly, on the eminent political service which he was
able to render them.</p>

<p class='c009'>When these pages shall come from the Press just three
hundred years will have elapsed since Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>’s
birth. Our English proto-collector was born in the year
1570. The year 1870 will, in all probability, witness the
definite solution of a knotty problem as to the future of
the great institution of which he was the primary and
central founder.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Cotton</span> may be regarded as the English ‘proto-collector,’
in a point of view other than that which concerns
the British Museum. No Library in the United Kingdom
can, I think, shew an <i>integral</i> ‘Collection,’ still extant, the
formation of which—as a Collection—can be traced to an
earlier date than that of the collection of the Cottonian
Manuscripts.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whether the <span class='sc'>British Museum</span> shall continue to be the
great national repository for Science, as well as for Literature
and Antiquities, is a question which is fast ripening for
decision; and it is one which ought to be interesting to all
Britons. It is also, and very eminently, one of those questions
of which it is literally—and not sarcastically—to be
affirmed that ‘there is much to be said on both sides.’</p>

<p class='c021'>Personally I have a very strong conviction on that
subject. But in treating of it—in the ‘Postscript’ which
closes the present volume—it has been my single and
earnest aim to state, with the utmost impartiality I am
able to attain, the leading arguments for maintaining the
Museum in its full integrity; and also the leading arguments
for severing the great Natural History Collections
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>from the rapidly growing Libraries and from the vast Galleries
of marbles, bronzes, pottery, medals, and prints. It
is the business of writers to state and marshal the evidence.
It is the business of Parliament to pronounce the judgment.</p>

<p class='c009'>The main epochs in the History of the British Museum
afford what may be looked upon almost as a ‘table of contents’
to the present volume. And they may be brought
under the Reader’s eye in a way which will much facilitate
the correct apprehension of the author’s plan. I exhibit
them thus:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Epochs of Brit. Museum growth and increase.</span></div>

<p class='c021'><i>Restored</i>, by <b>Henry, Prince of Wales</b>, in the
year 1609, by the purchase—and incorporation with the remnants
of an ancient collection—of the Library of <b>John de
Lumley, Lord Lumley</b> (Born <i>circa</i> 1530; Restored
in blood, as VIth Baron Lumley, in 1547: Died 1609);
<i>Continued</i> by <b>Charles I</b> and <b>Charles II</b>, <b>Kings of
England, &amp;c.</b>, from 1627 to 1683; <i>Given</i> to the
Nation by <b>King George the Second</b> in 1757.</p>

<p class='c025'>This <span class='sc'>Old Royal Library</span>, although, as above
mentioned, it still contains fragments of the more
ancient Collection of the Kings of England—and
among them books which undoubtedly belonged to
King <span class='sc'>Henry the Sixth</span>, if not to earlier Plantagenet
kings—may fairly be regarded as of Prince <span class='sc'>Henry</span>’s
foundation in the main. Lord <span class='sc'>Lumley</span>’s Library
(which the Prince bought in bulk) contained that of
his father-in-law, Henry <b>Fitzalan</b>, Earl of Arundel,
into which had passed a part of Archbishop <b>Cranmer’s</b>
Library. But this conjoined Collection has
not wholly passed to the British Museum. It suffered
some losses after Prince <span class='sc'>Henry</span>’s death. On the
other hand, it had acquired the collection of MSS.
formed by the <span class='sc'>Theyers</span> (John and Charles), in which
was included another part of the Library of <span class='sc'>Cranmer</span>;
as I shall shew hereafter.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Collected</i> by <b>Solomon Da Costa</b>, formerly of
Amsterdam, and chiefly between the years 1720 and 1727;
<i>Given</i> by the Collector, in 1759, to the Trustees of
the British Museum ‘for inspection and service of the
Public, as a small token of my esteem, reverence, love, and
gratitude to this magnanimous Nation, and as a thanksgiving
offering&#160;... for numberless blessings which
I have enjoyed under it.’ (From <span class='sc'>Da Costa</span>’s Letter to the
Trustees.)</p>

<p class='c025'>A collection, small in extent, but of great intrinsic
worth; and very memorable, both as the generous
gift of a good man; and as instancing the co-operation
(at the very outset) of the love of learning in a
foreigner—and a Jew—with a like love in Britons, for
a common object; national, indeed, but also much

<p class='c021'><i>Collected</i> by <b>George Thomason</b> (Died 1666);
<i>Purchased</i> by <b>King George the Third</b>, in 1762,
for presentation to the British Museum.</p>

<p class='c025'>This Collection—the interest of which is specially
but by no means exclusively political and historical—was
formed between the years 1641 and 1663 inclusive,
and it contains everything printed in England
during the whole of that period which a man of great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>enterprise and energy could bring together by daily
watchfulness and large outlay. It also contains many
publications, and many private impressions, from
printing-presses in Scotland, Ireland, and the Continent
of Europe, relating to or illustrating the affairs
of the United Kingdom and of the Commonwealth.
In his lifetime, the Collector refused £4000 for his
library, as insufficient to reimburse his costs, charges,
and labour. His heirs and their assigns kept it for a
century and then sold it to King George III for £300.
It includes many political MSS., which no printer
dared to put to press.</p>

<p class='c025'>The ‘Solander Fossils’—so called from the name

<p class='c020'><b>1823.</b> The <span class='sc'>Beaumont Gallery</span>.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Collected</i> by <b>Sir George Howland Beaumont</b>
(Died 7 February, 1827); <i>Given</i> by the Collector in 1823

death.</p>

<h6 class='c019'>(XXXV)</h6>

<p class='c020'><b>1830.</b> The <span class='sc'>Holwell-Carr Gallery</span>.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Collected</i> by the Reverend <b>William Holwell
Carr</b> (Died 24 December, 1830), and by the Collector
<i>bequeathed</i> to the British Museum. <i>Deposited</i> under
arrangements similar to those adopted for the Beaumont
Pictures in the National Gallery.</p>

<p class='c009'>These are the primary Accession-Collections that came
to the British Museum, during the first seventy years which
elapsed after its public opening (January, 1759). They
form a noble monument alike of the liberality and public
spirit of individual Englishmen, and of the fidelity of the
Trustees to the charge committed to them as a body.
And the reader will hardly have failed to notice how
remarkable a proportion of the most munificent of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Benefactors of the institution were, previously to their gifts,
numbered amongst its Trustees.</p>

<p class='c021'>If the liberality of Parliament failed to be elicited in due
correspondency—in respect either to the amount or the
frequency of its grants—to that of individuals, the failure
is rarely, if ever, ascribable to oversight or somnolency on
the part of the Trustees. If, during the lapse of those
seventy years, they obtained grants of public money which
amounted, in the aggregate, to but £151,762—little more,
on an average, than two thousand pounds a year—they
made not a few applications to which the Treasury, or the
House of Commons, refused to respond. Meanwhile, the
gifts of Benefactors probably much more than trebled the
public grants.</p>

<p class='c021'>At the outset, the Museum was divided into three
‘Departments’ only: (1) <i>Manuscripts</i>; (2) <i>Printed Books</i>;
(3) <i>Natural History</i>.</p>

<p class='c021'>The acquisition, in 1801, of the Alexandrian monuments,
was the first accession which gave prominence to the
‘Antiquities’—theretofore regarded as little more than a
curious appendage to the Natural History Collections.
Four years later came the Townley Marbles. It was then
obvious that a new Department ought to be made. This
change was effected in 1807. The Marbles and minor
Antiquities, together with the Prints, Drawings, Coins, and
Medals (formerly appended to the Departments of Printed
Books and of MSS.) were formed into a separate department.
Twenty years afterwards the ‘Botanical Department’
was created, on the reception of the Banksian herbaria
and their appendant Collections. The division into five
departments continued down to the date of the Parliamentary
inquiry of 1835–36 [Book III, Chapter 1]. Soon
afterwards (1837), the immediate custody of the ‘Prints and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Drawings’ was severed from that of the ‘Antiquities’ and
made a special charge. In like manner, the Department
of ‘Natural History’ was also (1837) subdivided; but in
this instance the one department became, eventually, three:
(1) Zoology; (2) Palæontology; (3) Mineralogy. The two
last-named divisions were first separated in 1857. How
the eight departments of 1860 have become <i>twelve</i> in 1869
will be seen hereafter.</p>

<p class='c021'>It will also, I think, become apparent that this subdivision
of Departments has contributed, in an important measure,
to the enlargement of the several Collections; as well as to
their better arrangement, and to other exigencies of the
public service.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have now to enumerate the more salient and important
among the many successive acquisitions of the last forty
years. Taken collectively, they have so enlarged the proportions
of the national repository as to make the ‘British
Museum’ of 1831 seem, in the retrospect, as if, at that
time, it had been yet in its infancy.</p>

<p class='c021'>In 1831 there were still living—here and there—a few
ancient Londoners whose personal recollections extended
over the whole period during which the Museum had existed.
One or two of them could, perhaps, still call to mind
something of the aspect which the gaily painted and decorated
rooms of old Montagu House presented when—as
children—they had been permitted to accompany some
fortunate possessor of a ticket of admission to ‘see the
curiosities;’ and were hurried by the Cerberus in charge
for the day from room to room; the Cerberus aforesaid
(unless his memory has been libelled) seeming to count the
minutes, if a visitor chanced to show the least desire for a
closer inspection of anything which caught his eye. And,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>in some points—although certainly not in that point—the
Museum of 1831 was not very greatly altered, much as it
had been enlarged, from the Museum of 1759. Cerberus
had long quitted his post; but many portions of the
Collections he had had in charge retained their wonted
aspect, much as he had left them.</p>

<p class='c021'>Such octogenarian survivors—if endowed with a good
memory—would see, in their latest visits to Great Russell
Street much more to remind them of what they had seen
in the first, than a new visitor of 1831 could now see,—in
1869,—were he, in his turn, striving to recall the impressions
of <i>his</i> earliest visit.</p>

<p class='c009'>The period now to be briefly outlined—in order to a fair
preliminary view of our subject—is marked, like that of
1759–1831, by continued munificence on the part of
private donors; but it is also marked—unlike that—by
some approach towards proportionate liberality from the
keepers of the public purse; as well as by energetic and
persistent efforts for internal improvement, on the part
both of Trustees and of Officers. It forms a quite new
epoch. It may be said, unexaggeratedly, to have witnessed
a re-foundation of the Museum, in almost everything that
bears on its direct utility to the public.</p>

<p class='c021'>In regard to this last period, however—no less than in
regard to the foregoing one—only the more salient Collections
can here be enumerated. Many minor ones have
been passed over already, notwithstanding their intrinsic
value. Many others—equally meriting notice, were space
for it available—will have, in like manner, to be passed
over now.</p>

<p class='c009'>As I have had occasion to observe in a former paragraph,
the preceding list is, of necessity, an abridged list. It is
by no means a complete or exhaustive one. The prescribed
bounds—those of a single volume for a very wide and
multifarious subject—compel the writer to treat his subject
by way of selection. The reader is solicited to keep that
fact in mind; as well for its bearing on the chapters which
follow, as on the introductory chapter now under his eye.
And in regard both to this brief enumeration of the successive
component parts of the Museum, and to the biographical
notices of which it is the preliminary, the cautionary
remark here repeated applies to <i>every</i> Department of the
national repository. It holds good of the Natural History
Collections, and of the Collections of Antiquities, no less
than of the Collections of Printed Books and of Manuscripts.</p>

<p class='c021'>Among the many minor, but intrinsically important,
Collections thus—compulsorily—passed over, in the present
volume, are some of which brief notices have been given
(by the same hand) in a preceding work, published in
1869. Those ‘Notices,’ however, relate exclusively to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>collectors and collections of Printed Books, of Engravings,
of Drawings, and of Manuscripts. Thus,—to give but a few
examples,—important collections, now forming part of the
British Museum, and gathered originally by <b>Thomas
Rymer</b> (1713); <b>Thomas Madox</b> (1733); <b>Brownlow
Cecil, Earl of Exeter</b> (1739); <b>David
Garrick</b> (1779); <b>Peter Lewis Ginguene</b>
(1816); the <b>Abate Canonici</b> (<i>circa</i>, 1818); <b>John
Fowler Hull</b> (1825); <b>Frederick North</b>, sixth
<b>Earl of Guildford</b> (1826); <b>Count Joseph de
Puisaye</b> (1827); the <b>Marquess Wellesley</b>
(1842); <b>D. E. Davy</b> (<i>circa</i> 1850),—are all noticed in an
Appendix headed ‘Historical Notices of Collectors’ to the
volume entitled ‘<i>Free Town Libraries</i>’ published in 1869.
Of that Appendix the notices above referred to form, respectively,
Nos. ‘848’ (<i>Rymer</i>); ‘570’ (<i>Madox</i>); ‘186’
(<i>Cecil</i>); ‘351’ (<i>Garrick</i>); ‘372’ (<i>Ginguene</i>); ‘165’
(<i>Canonici</i>); ‘462’ (<i>Hull</i>); ‘683’ (<i>North</i>); ‘781’ (<i>Puisaye</i>);
‘1049’ (<i>Wellesley</i>); and ‘249’ (<i>Davy</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>The existing constitution of the Board of Trustees of the
British Museum has been on many occasions, and by
several writers, somewhat freely impugned. More than
once it has been the subject of criticism in the House of
Commons. With little alteration that Board remains, in
1869, what Parliament made it in 1753. Obviously, it
might be quite possible to frame a new governing Corporation,
in a fashion more accordant with what are sometimes
called the ‘progressive tendencies’ of the period.</p>

<p class='c021'>But I venture to think that the bare enumeration of the
facts which have now been briefly tabulated, in this
introductory chapter, gives a proof of faithful and zealous
administration of a great trust, such as cannot be gainsaid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>by any the most ardent lover of innovation. Both the
Collections given, and the Collections purchased, afford
conclusive and splendid proofs that the Trustees and the
Officers have alike won the confidence and merited the
gratitude of those whose acquirements and pursuits in life
have best qualified them to give a verdict on the implied
issue.</p>

<p class='c009'>If, of late years, the public purse has been opened with
somewhat more of an approach to harmony with the openhandedness
of private Englishmen, that result is wholly due
to unremitting effort on the part both of the Trustees who
govern, and of the Officers who administer, or have administered,
the British Museum. And, to attain their end,
both Trustees and Officers have, very often, had to fight
hard, as the later chapters of this volume will more than
sufficiently show.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Book I</span>, Chap. II. <span class='sc'>Life of Sir Robert Cotton.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> was the eldest son of Thomas <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>
of Conington and of Elizabeth <span class='sc'>Shirley</span>, daughter of Francis
<span class='sc'>Shirley</span> of Staunton-Harold in Leicestershire. He was
born on the 22nd of January, 1570, at Denton, in the
county of Huntingdon. Denton was a sort of jointure-house
attached to that ancient family seat of Conington,
which had come into the possession of the Cottons, about
the middle of the preceding century, by the marriage of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>William <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> with Mary <span class='sc'>Wesenham</span>, daughter and
heir of Robert <span class='sc'>Wesenham</span>, who had acquired Conington
by his marriage with Agnes <span class='sc'>Bruce</span>.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c030'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Parentage and Ancestry of Sir Robert Cotton.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The Cottons of Conington were an offshoot of the old
Cheshire stock. They held a good local position in right
of their manorial possessions both in Huntingdonshire and
in Cambridgeshire, but they had not, as yet, won distinction
by any very conspicuous public service. Genealogically,
their descent, through Mary <span class='sc'>Wesenham</span>, from Robert
<span class='sc'>Bruce</span>, was their chief boast. Sir Robert was to become,
as he grew to manhood, especially proud of it. He rarely
missed an opportunity of commemorating the fact, and
sometimes seized occasions for recording it, heraldically,
after a fashion which has put stumbling-blocks in the way
of later antiquaries. But the weakness has about it
nothing of meanness. It is not an unpardonable failing.
And with the specially antiquarian virtues it is not less closely
allied than with love of country. In days of court favour,
<span class='sc'>James the First</span> was wont to please Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>
by calling him cousin. Sir Robert’s descendants became,
in their turn, proud of his personal celebrity, but they too
were, at all times, as careful to celebrate, upon the family
monuments, their Bruce descent, as to claim a share in the
literary glories of the ‘Cottonian Library.’</p>

<p class='c029'>This cousinship with King James—and also a matter
which to Sir Robert was much more important, the descent
to the Cottons of the rich Lordship of Conington with its
appendant manors and members—will be seen, at a glance,
by the following—</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> was educated at Trinity College in Cambridge,
where he took the degree of B.A. towards the close
of 1585.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c030'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Of his collegiate career very little is discoverable,

<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Cotton’s Early Friendships.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Long
before he left Trinity, he had given unmistakeable proofs of
his love for archæology. Some among the many conspicuous
and lifelong friendships which he formed with men
likeminded took their beginnings at Cambridge, but most
of them were formed during his periodical and frequent
sojourns in London. John <span class='sc'>Josceline</span>, William <span class='sc'>Dethick</span>,
Lawrence <span class='sc'>Nowell</span>, William <span class='sc'>Lambarde</span>, and William
<span class='sc'>Camden</span> were amongst his earliest and closest friends.
Most of them were much his seniors. Whilst still in the
heyday of youth he married Elizabeth <span class='sc'>Brocas</span>, daughter and
eventually coheir of William <span class='sc'>Brocas</span> of Thedingworth in
Leicestershire. Soon after his marriage he took a leading
part in the establishment of the first Society of Antiquaries.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Some of <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> fellow-workers in the Society are known
to all of us by their surviving writings. Others of them
are now almost forgotten, though not less deserving,
perhaps, of honourable memory; for amongst these latter
was—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c033'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>‘that good Earl, once President</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'>at a time when such praise could seldom be given
truthfully. It was as a contributor towards the common
labours of that Society that <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> made his earliest
appearance as an author. The subjects chosen for his discourses
at the periodical meetings of the Elizabethan antiquarians
indicate the prevalent bias of his mind. Nearly
all of them may be said to belong to our political
archæology.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Growth of the Cottonian Library and Gallery.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Before the close of the sixteenth century, his collections
of Manuscripts and of Antiquities had already become so
large and important as to win for him a wide reputation
in foreign countries, as well as at home. His correspondence
indicates, even at that early period, a generous
recognition of the brotherhood of literature, the world
over, and proves the ready courtesy with which he had
learned to bear somewhat more than his fair share of the
obligations thence arising. In later days he was wont to
say to his intimates: ‘I, myself, have the smallest share in
myself.’ From youth, onwards, there is abundant evidence
that the saying expressed, unboastingly, the simple facts of
his daily life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Friendship with Camden.</span></div>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Camden</span> was amongst the earliest of those intimates,
and to the dying day of the author of the <i>Britannia</i> the
close friendship which united him with <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> was both
unbroken and undiminished. The former was still in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>full vigour of life when <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> had given proof of his
worthiness to be a fellow-labourer in the field of English
antiquities. In 1599 they went, in company, over the
northern counties; explored together many an old abbey
and many a famous battle-field. When that tour was
made, the evidences of the ruthless barbarism with which
the mandates of <span class='sc'>Henry the Eighth</span> had been carried out
by his agents lay still thick upon the ground, and may well
have had their influence in modifying some of the religious
views and feelings of such tourists. Not a few chapters of
the <i>Britannia</i> embody the researches of <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> as well as
those of <span class='sc'>Camden</span>; and the elder author was ever ready to
acknowledge his deep sense of obligation to his younger
colleague. For both of them, at this time, and in subsequent
years, the storied past was more full of interest
than the politics, howsoever momentous or exciting, of
the day. But, occasionally, they corresponded on questions
of policy as well as of history. There is evidence that on
one stirring subject, about which men’s views were much
wont to run to extremes, they agreed in advocating moderate
courses. In the closing years of the Queen, <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>,
as well as <span class='sc'>Camden</span>, recognised the necessity that the
Government should hold a firm hand over the emissaries
of the Church and Court of Rome, whilst refusing to admit
that a due repression of hostile intrigues was inconsistent
with the honourable treatment of conscientious and peaceful
Romanists.</p>

<p class='c029'>It was, in all probability, almost immediately after
<span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> return from the Archæological tour to the North
which he had made with his early friend, that he received
a message from the Queen. <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span> had been told of
his growing fame for possessing an acquaintance with the
mustiest of records, and an ability ‘to vouch precedents’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>such as few students, even of much riper years, had
attained to. He was now to be acquainted with a dispute
about national precedency which had arisen at Calais
between Sir Henry <span class='sc'>Neville</span> and the Ambassador of
Spain.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Tractate on English precedency over Spain.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It was Her Majesty’s wish that he should search
the records which bore upon the question, and send her
such a report as might strengthen <span class='sc'>Neville’s</span> hands in his
contest for the honour of England.</p>

<p class='c029'>Such a task could not fail to be a welcome one; and
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span> found no lack of pertinent evidence. The bent
and habit of his mind were always methodical. He begins
his abstract of the records by tabulating his argument.
Precedency, he says, must have respect either to the nation
or to the ruler of the nation. A kingdom must rank either
(1) according to its antiquity, or (2) according to ‘the
eminency of the throne royal,’ by which phrase he means
the complete unity of the dominion under one supreme
ruler. On the first title to precedency he observes that it
may be based either upon the date of national independence,
or upon that of the national recognition of Christianity. He
claims for England that it was a monarchy at least four
hundred and sixty years before Castile became one; that
Christianity had then been established in it, without break
or interruption, for a thousand years;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Cottoni Posthuma</i>, pp. 76, 77.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
whereas in Spain
Christianity was ‘defaced with Moorish Mahumetisme,’
until the expulsion of the Moors by <span class='sc'>Ferdinand</span>, little more
than a century before the time at which he was writing.</p>

<p class='c029'>His assertion of the greater ‘eminency of the throne
royal’ in England than in Spain is mainly founded on the
union in the English sovereignty alone of supreme ecclesiastical
with supreme civil power; and on the lineal descent
of the then sovereign ‘from Christian princes for 800
years,’ whereas the descent of the Kings of Spain ‘is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>chiefly from the Earls of Castilia, about 500 years since,’
and the then King of Spain was ‘yet in the infancy of his
kingdom.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Two minor and ancillary arguments in this tract are
also notable: The Spanish throne, says <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, hath not,
as hath the English and French, ‘that virtue to endow the
king therein invested with the power to heal the king’s
evil; for into France do yearly come multitudes of Spaniards
to be healed thereof.’ And he further alleges that ‘absolute
power of the King of England, which in other kingdoms
is much restrained.’ The time was to come when
the close friend and fellow-combatant of <span class='sc'>Eliot</span> and the
other framers of the great ‘Petition of Right’ would rank
himself with the foremost in ‘much restraining’ the kingly
power in England, and would discover ample warrant in
ancient precedents for every step of the process. But, as
yet, that time was afar off.</p>

<p class='c029'>Immediately on the accession of King <span class='sc'>James</span>, Sir Robert
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span> greeted the new monarch with two other and far
more remarkable tractates on a subject bearing closely on
our relations with Spain. Their political interest, as contributions
to the history of public opinion, is great. Their
biographical interest is still greater. But I postpone the
consideration of them until we reach a momentous crisis in
Sir Robert’s life on which they have a vital bearing. He
also wrote,—almost simultaneously,—a much more courtierlike
‘<i>Discourse of his Majesty’s descent from the Saxon
Kings</i>,’ which was graciously welcomed.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Domestic Correspondence</i>, James I, vol. i, f. 3 (R. H.).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In the following
September he received the honour of knighthood.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Returned to Parliament.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In
<span class='sc'>James’</span> first Parliament he sat for the County of Huntingdon,
in fellowship with Sir Oliver <span class='sc'>Cromwell</span>, uncle of the
future Protector. There is no evidence that at this period
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>he took any active part in debate. Nor did he, at any
time, win distinction as a debater. But in the labours of
Committees he was soon both zealous and prominent.
Two classes of questions, in particular, appear to have
engaged his attention:—questions of Church discipline,
and questions of administrative reform.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Dom. Cor.</i> as above; vol. xix, pp. 37 seqq.; vol. xxvii, pp. 44 seqq. (R. H.); MS. Cott. Jul. C., iii, p. 10. (B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He also assisted
Bacon in the difficult attempt to frame acceptable measures
for a union with Scotland.</p>

<p class='c029'>The fame of his library and of his museum of antiquities
continued to spread farther and wider. He had many
agents on the Continent who sought diligently to augment
his collections. His correspondence with men who were
busied in like pursuits both at home and abroad increased.
Much of it has survived. On that interesting point at
which a glance has been cast already, its witness is uniform.
He was always as ready to impart as he was eager to
collect. Few, if any, important works of historical research
were carried on in his day to which he did not, in some
way or other, give generous furtherance. At a time when
he was most busy in forming his own library, he helped
<span class='sc'>Bodley</span> to lay the foundation of the noble library at
Oxford.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Further Growth and Sources of the Cottonian Library.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Readers who can call to mind even mere fragments of
that superabundant evidence which tells of the neglect
throughout much of the Tudor period of the public archives
of the realm, can feel little surprise that Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>
should have been able to collect a multitude of documents
which had once been the property of the nation, or of the
sovereign. Those who are most familiar with that evidence
ought to be the first to remember that, under the known
circumstances of the time, the presumption of honest
acquisition is stronger than that of dishonest, whenever
conclusive proof of either is absent. English State Papers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>had passed into the possession not only of English antiquarians,
but of English booksellers—and not a few of them
into that of foreigners—before <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> was born. Other
considerations bearing on this matter, and tending as it
seems in a like direction, belong to a later period of Sir
Robert’s life. There is, however, a very weighty one which
stands at the threshold of his career as a collector.</p>

<p class='c029'>Almost the earliest incident which is recorded of <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span>
youthful days, is his concurrence in a petition in
which Queen <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span> was entreated to establish a Public
and National Library, and to honour it with her own name.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Attempt of Cotton and Camden to Establish a National Library.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Its especial and prime object was to be the collection and
preservation, as public property, of the monuments of our
English history. The proposal was not altogether new.
It was a much improved revival of a project which Dr. John
<span class='sc'>Dee</span> had once submitted, in an immature form, to Queen
<span class='sc'>Mary</span>. It was the reiteration of an earnest request which
had been made to Queen <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span> by Archbishop <span class='sc'>Parker</span>,
at a time when <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> was still in his cradle. The joint
petition of <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> and <span class='sc'>Camden</span> met with as little success
as had attended the entreaties of those who had taken the
same path before them.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Petition, &amp;c.</i> (undated) in Cotton MS. Faustina, E. V, ff. 67, 68.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The petitioners were willing to
bind themselves, and others like-minded, to incur ‘costs, and
charges,’ for the effectual attainment of their patriotic object,
on the condition of royal patronage and royal fellow-working
with them in its pursuit. When <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, upon
bare presumptions, is charged to be an embezzler of records,
this Petition comes to have a very obvious relevancy to the
matter in question. The relevancy is enhanced by the fact
that two, at least, of those who had (at various times)
concurred in promoting its object, gave to the Library of
their fellow-labourer in the field of antiquity, manuscripts
and records which, had the issue of their project been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>otherwise, they would have given to the ‘Public Library of
Queen <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span>,’ in express trust for their fellow-countrymen
at large.</p>

<p class='c029'>Indirectly, this same petition has also its bearing on a
curious passage relating to Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> which occurs
among the Minute-books of the Corporation of London,
and which has recently been printed by Mr. <span class='sc'>Riley</span>, in his
preface to <i>Liber Custumarum</i>.</p>

<p class='c029'>On the 10th of November, 1607, the Court of Aldermen
of London recorded the following minute:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Cotton and the City Records of London.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘It is this
day ordered, that Mr. Chamberlain, Mr. Town Clerk,
Mr. <span class='sc'>Edmonds</span>, and Mr. Robert <span class='sc'>Smith</span>, or any three of
them, shall repair to Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, from this Court,
and require him to deliver to the City’s use three of the
City’s books <i>which have been long time missing</i>—the first
book called <i>Liber Custumarum</i>; the second, called <i>Liber
Legum Antiquorum</i>; and the thirde, called <i>Fletewode</i>, which
are affirmed to be in his custody.’ Of the results of the
interview of Master Chamberlain and his fellow-ambassadors
with <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> no precise account has been preserved.
It is plain, however, from the sequel, that they found the
matter to be one for which such extremely curt ‘requisition’
was scarcely the appropriate mode of setting to work.
The Corporation appealed in vain to the Lord Privy Seal
<span class='sc'>Northampton</span>; and they had afterwards to solicit the
mediation with <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> of two of their own members—Sir
John <span class='sc'>Jolles</span> and another—who were personally known to
him. Their interposition was alike ineffectual. Of the
interview we have no report; but Sir Robert, it is clear,
asserted his right to retain the City books (or rather portions
of books) which were then in his hands, and he did
retain them. They now form part of the well-known and
very valuable Cottonian MS., ‘Claudius D. XI.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>That these London records had once belonged to the
citizens is now unquestioned. That Cotton—both in 1607
and again in the following year—asserted a title, of some
sort, to those of them which were then in his hands,
seems also to be established. Is the fair inference this:
‘Their then holder, in 1607, had obtained them wrongfully,
and he persisted, despite all remonstrance, in his
wrongful possession’? Is it not rather to be inferred that,
whosoever may have been the original wrongdoer, Sir
Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> had acquired them by a lawful purchase?
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Dispute about City Records.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If that should have been the fact, he may possibly have had
a valid reason for declining to give what he had, ineffectually
and rudely, been commanded to restore.</p>

<p class='c029'>On the other hand, it is impossible to defend Sir
Robert’s occasional mode of dealing with MSS.,—some of
which, it is plain, were but lent to him,—when, by misplacement
of leaves, or by insertions, and sometimes by both
together, he confused their true sequence and aspect. Of this
unjustifiable manipulation I shall have to speak hereafter.</p>

<p class='c035'>The years which followed close upon this little civic
interlude were amongst the busiest years of <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> public
life. He testified the sincerity of his desire to serve his
country faithfully, by the choice of the subjects to the study
of which he voluntarily bent his powers.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Cotton’s Memorial on Abuses in the Navy.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c029'>Abuses in the management of the navy and of naval
establishments have been at most periods of our history
fruitful topics for reformers, competent or other. In the
early years of <span class='sc'>James</span> there was a special tendency to the
increase of such abuses in the growing unfitness for exertion
of the Lord High Admiral. <span class='sc'>Nottingham</span> had yet
many years to live,—near as he had been to the threescore
and ten when the new reign began. But even his large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>appetencies were now almost sated with wealth, employments,
and honours; and ever since his return from his
splendid embassy to Spain, he seemed bent on compensating
himself for his hard labour under <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span> by his
indolent luxury under <span class='sc'>James</span>. The repose of their chief
had so favoured the illegitimate activities of his subordinates,
that when <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> addressed himself to the task of
investigating the state of the naval administration he soon
found that it would be much easier to prove the existence and
the gravity of the abuses than to point to an effectual remedy.</p>

<p class='c029'>The abuses were manifold. Some of them were, at that
moment, scarcely assailable. To <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, in particular,
the approach to the subject was beset with many difficulties.
He was, however, much in earnest.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Inquiry instituted by Cotton into Abuses in the Royal Navy.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When he
found that some of the obstacles must, for the present,
be rather turned by evasion than be encountered—with
any fair chance of success—by an open attack in front, he
betook himself to the weaker side of the enemy. He
obtained careful information as to naval account-keeping;
discovered serious frauds; and opened the assault by a
conflict with officials not too powerful for immediate
encounter,—though far indeed from being unprotected.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cotton, <i>Memorial on Abuses of the Navy;—Domestic Corresp.</i> James I, vol. xli, p. 21. (R. H).</div>

<p class='c029'>Of Sir Robert’s <i>Memorial</i> to the King, I can give but
one brief extract, by way of sample: ‘Upon a dangerous
advantage,’ he writes, ‘which the Treasurer of the Navy
taketh by the strict letter of his Patent, to be discharged of
all his accounts by the only vouchee and allowance of <i>two</i>
chief officers, it falls out, strangely, at this time—by the
weakness of the Controller and cunning of the Surveyor—that
these two offices are, in effect, but <i>one</i>, which is the Surveyor
himself, who—joining with the Treasurer as a Purveyor
of all provisions—becomes a paymaster to himself&#160;... at
such rates as <i>he</i> thinks good.’ It is a suggestive statement.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span><span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> most intimate political friendships were at this
time with the <span class='sc'>Howards</span>. Henry <span class='sc'>Howard</span> (now Earl of
Northampton),—whatever the intrinsic baseness and perfidy
of his nature, was a man of large capacity. He was not
unfriendly to reform,—when abuses put no pelf in his own
pocket. To naval reforms, his nearness of blood to <span class='sc'>Nottingham</span>,
the Lord High Admiral, tended rather to predispose
him; for when near relatives dislike one another,
the intensity of their dislike is sometimes wonderful to all
bystanders. Interest made these two sometimes allies, but
it never made them friends. <span class='sc'>Northampton</span> gave his whole
influence in favour of Sir Robert’s plan. He began the
inquiries into this wide subject by persuading the King to
appoint a Commission. On the 30th of April, 1608,
Letters Patent were issued, in the preamble of which the
pith of the Memorial is thus recited: ‘We are informed
that very great and considerable abuses, deceits, frauds,
corruptions, negligences, misdemeanours and offences have
been and daily are perpetrated&#160;... <i>against the continual
admonitions and directions of you, our Lord High
Admiral</i>, by other the officers of and concerning our Navy
Royal, and by the Clerks of the Prick and Check, and
divers other inferior officers, ministers, mariners, soldiers,
and others working or labouring in or about our said
Navy;’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Commission for Inquiry on the Abuses in the Navy.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and thereupon full powers are given to the Commissioners
so appointed to make full inquiry into the
allegations; and to certify their proceedings and opinions.
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span> was made a member of the Commission, and at
the head of it were placed the Earls of <span class='sc'>Northampton</span> and
of <span class='sc'>Nottingham</span>. It was directed that the inquiry should
be carried at least as far back as the year 1598. The
Admiral’s share was little more than nominal. The proceedings
were opened on the 7th of May, 1608, when, as</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span><span class='sc'>Cotton</span> himself reports, an ‘elegant speech was made
by Lord Northampton, of His Majesty’s provident and
princely purposes for reformation of the abuses.’ Northampton,
he adds, ‘took especial pains and care for a full
and faithful discharge of that trust.’ At his instance Sir
Robert was made Chairman of a sort of sub-committee,
to which the preliminary inquiries and general array of the
business were entrusted;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Proceedings in the Commission for the Navy Royal</i>; MS. <span class='sc'>Cott.</span> Julius F. iii, fol. 1. (B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span> ‘Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, during all
the time of this service, entertaining his assistants at his
house at the Blackfriars as often as occasion served.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The inquiry lasted from May, 1608, to June, 1609.
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span> was then requested by his fellow-commissioners to
make an abstract of the depositions to be reported to the
King. It abundantly justified the Memorial of 1608.
<span class='sc'>James</span>, when he had read it, ordered a final meeting of the
Commissioners to be held in his presence, at which all
the inculpated officers were to attend that they might
adduce whatever answers or pleas of defence might be in
their power. ‘In the end,’ says Sir Robert, ‘they were
advised rather to cast themselves at the feet of his grace
and goodness for pardon, than to rely upon their weak
replies; which they readily did.’ The most important
outcome of the inquiry was the preparation of a ‘<i>Book of
Ordinances for the Navy Royal</i>,’ in the framing of which
Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> had the largest share. It led to many
improvements. But, in subsequent years, measures of a
still more stringent character were found needful.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Inquiry into Crown Revenues.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>In the next year after the presentation of this Report on
the Navy, Sir Robert addressed to the King another Report
on the Revenues of the Crown. The question is treated
historically rather than politically, but the long induction
of fiscal records is frequently enlivened by keen glances
both at underlying principles and at practical results.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Once or twice, at least, these side glances are such as, when
we now regard them, in the light of the subsequent history
of <span class='sc'>James’s</span> own reign and of that of his next successor, seem
to have in them more of irony than of earnest. The style
of the treatise is clear, terse, and pointed.</p>

<p class='c029'>On no branch of the subject does the author go into
more minute detail than on that delicate one of the historical
precedents for ‘abating and reforming excesses of the
Royal Household, Retinue, and Favourites.’ He points
the moral by express reference to existing circumstances.
Thus, for example, in treating of the arrangements of the
royal household, he says, ‘There is never a back-door at
Court that costs not the king £2000 yearly;’ and again,
when treating of gifts to royal favourites: ‘It is one of
the greatest accusations against the Duke of Somerset
for suffering the King [<span class='sc'>Edward VI</span>] to give away the
possessions and profits of the Crown in manner of a
spoil.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Not less plainspoken are <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> words about a question
that was destined, in a short time, to excite the whole
kingdom. Tonnage and poundage, he says, were granted
simply for defence of the State, ‘so they may be employed
in the wars; and particular Treasurers account in Parliament’
for that employment.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Proceedings in the Commission for the Navy Royal, &amp;c.</i>; as above.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘They are so granted,’ he adds,
‘in express words; and that they proceed of goodwill, not
of duty. Precedents of this nature are plentiful in all the
Rolls.’ A final example of this sort may be found in the
pithy warning grounded upon <span class='sc'>Richard the Second’s</span>
grant to a minion of the power of compounding with
delinquents. It was fatal, he says, both to the king and
to his instrument. ‘It grew the death of the one and the
deposition of the other.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> Report on the Crown Revenues has also an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>incidental interest. Out of it grew the creation of the
new dignity of baronets. Were His Majesty, says the writer,
‘now to make a degree of honour hereditary as Baronets,
next under Barons, and grant them in tail, taking of every
one £1000, in fine it would raise with ease £100,000;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Cotton’s Proposition for the Creation of Baronets</span>, 1609.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and, <i>by a judicious election</i>, be a means to content those
worthy persons in the Commonwealth that by the confused
admission of [so] many Knights of the Bath held themselves
all this time disgraced.’ When this passage was
written that which had been, under <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span>, so real and
eminent an honour as to be eagerly coveted by patriotic
men, had been lavished by <span class='sc'>James</span> with a profusion which
entailed their contempt and disgust. I have before me the
fine old MS. from a passage in which <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> borrowed the
title of the new dignity.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>9 R. II. Durh. 17 July, 1385. <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> MS., Nero D., vi, § 16. (B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The word occurs thus:—‘<i>Ceux
sont les estatutz, ordenances&#160;... de n̄re très excellent souv
seigneur le Roy Richard, et Johan, Duc de Lancastre,&#160;...
et des autres Contes, Barons, et</i> Baronnetz, <i>et sages Chivalers</i>.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Sir Robert was himself amongst the earliest receivers
(June, 1611) of the new order. Its creation led to many
jealousies and discords. It gave both to the King and to
his councillors not a little trouble in settling the precise
privileges and precedencies of its holders. In those controversies
the author of the suggestion took no very active
part. King <span class='sc'>James</span> was much more anxious for the speedy
receipt of the hundred thousand pounds, than about
the ‘judicious election’ of those by whom the money was
to be provided. <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> satisfaction with the ultimate
working out of his plan must have had its large alloy.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c030'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>This is the more apparent, inasmuch as, at the first
acceptance of his project, Sir Robert had obtained the
King’s distinct promise that no future creation of a baron
should be made, until the new peer had first received the
degree of baronet; unless he belonged to a family already
ennobled. Hearing of a probability that the royal promise
in this respect was likely to be broken, he wrote to Somerset:—‘If
His Highness <i>will</i> do it, I rather humbly beg a
relinquishing in the design of the baronets, as desponding
of good success.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cotton to Somerset (undated) MS. Harl., 7002, f. 380. (B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But to James all projects for the opening
of gold mines—whether at home or abroad—were much
too attractive to be staved off by any puritanic scruples
about pledge or promise. For him, from youth to dotage,
the one thing needful was gold.</p>

<p class='c035'>The question of the baronetcies is one of the earliest
which brings us in presence of the eventful political connection
which subsisted between <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> and the Earl of
<span class='sc'>Somerset</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Political Intercourse of Sir R. Cotton with Lord Somerset.</span> 1613–1615.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Of its first beginnings no precise testimony
seems to have survived. But there is a strong presumption
that when <span class='sc'>Somerset</span> was led, by his fatal love for Lady
<span class='sc'>Essex</span>, to change his early position of antagonism to the
<span class='sc'>Howards</span> for one of alliance and friendship, he came frequently
into contact with Sir Robert, who had long been
familiarly acquainted with the Earl of <span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>—and also
with his too well-known Countess—as well as with the Earl
of <span class='sc'>Northampton</span>.</p>

<p class='c029'>The one ineffaceable stigma on <span class='sc'>Somerset’s</span> memory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>which was brought upon him by his disgraceful marriage
has barred the way to an impartial estimate of his standing
as a politician. A man who was branded by his peers
(though upon garbled depositions) as a murderer can
scarcely, by possibility, have his pretensions to statesmanship
fairly weighed in a just balance. Such testimony,
it is true, as that on which <span class='sc'>Somerset</span> was found guilty of
the poisoning of <span class='sc'>Overbury</span> would not now suffice to convict
a vagrant of petty larceny. It would not indeed at
this day be treated as evidence at all; it would be looked
upon as a mere decoction of surmises. But the foul scandal
of the marriage itself has so tainted <span class='sc'>Somerset’s</span> very name
that historians (almost with one consent) have condoned the
baseness of his prosecutors.</p>

<p class='c029'>With some of this man’s contemporaries it was quite
otherwise. Some English statesmen whose names we have
all learnt to venerate, looked upon the murder of <span class='sc'>Overbury</span>
as a revengeful deed instigated by Lady <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>, wholly
without her husband’s complicity; and they looked at
<span class='sc'>Somerset’s</span> conviction of complicity in the crime as simply
the issue of a skilfully-managed court intrigue, for a court
object. They knew that <span class='sc'>Somerset’s</span> enemies had been
wont to say amongst themselves, ‘A nail is best driven out
by driving in another nail,’ and had, very effectually, put the
proverb into action. They knew, too, that to the rising
favourite the King had committed—most characteristically—the
pleasing task of communicating, on his behalf,
with the Crown lawyers, as their own task of compiling the
depositions against the falling favourite went on from stage
to stage.</p>

<p class='c029'>Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> believed not only that <span class='sc'>Somerset</span> was
guiltless of the murder of <span class='sc'>Overbury</span>, and that the Earl’s
political extinction was resolved upon, as the readiest means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>of making room for a new favourite, but he also believed
that <span class='sc'>Somerset’s</span> loss of power involved the loss by England—for
a long time to come—of some useful domestic
reforms, as well as its subjection to several new abuses.
This belief was a favourite subject of conversation with him
to his dying day. He was in the habit of imparting it to
the famous men who, in the early years of the next reign,
joined with him in fighting the battles of parliamentary
freedom against royal prerogative. There may well have
been an element of truth in <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> view of the matter,
though, in these days, it seems but a barren pursuit to
have discussed the preferability to England of the rule
of a Robert <span class='sc'>Carr</span> rather than that of a George <span class='sc'>Villiers</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Cotton and the projected Spanish Match.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>What is now chiefly important in the close political connection
which was formed between <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> and <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>
is the fact that it eventually thrust Sir Robert’s fortune and
entire future into great peril, even if it did not actually
hazard his life itself, as well as his fair fame with posterity.
The life that was preserved to him was also to be redeemed
by future and brilliant public service.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1615.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
His fortune sustained
no great damage, and much of it was afterwards
spent upon public objects. His reputation as a statesman,
however, suffered, and must suffer, some degree of loss.
<span class='sc'>Somerset</span> led him to become an agent in urging on the
treaty for the marriage of Prince <span class='sc'>Charles</span> with the Infanta
of Spain. As it seems, his agency was—for a very brief
period—even active and zealous. Neither <span class='sc'>Somerset</span> nor
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, however, set that intercourse with <span class='sc'>Gondomar</span> afoot
which presently brought Sir Robert within the toils.
It was pleasantly originated by the wily Spaniard himself,
in the character of <i>a lover of antiquities</i>, deeply anxious to
study Sir Robert’s Museum, in its owner’s company.</p>

<p class='c029'>It is unfortunate for a truthful estimate of the <i>degree</i> of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>discredit attachable to Cotton for this agency in promoting
a scheme pregnant with dishonour to England, that little
evidence of the share he took in it is now to be derived
from any English source. His own extant correspondence
yields very little, though it suffices to establish the fact of
the agency, apart from that testimony of <span class='sc'>Gondomar</span>, which
will be cited presently.</p>

<p class='c029'>Under <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> own hand we have the fact that in
a conversation with himself the Ambassador of Spain
on one occasion held out (by way, it seems, more immediately,
of inducement to the English Government to shape
certain pending negotiations on other matters into greater
conformity with <i>Spanish</i> counsels)
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cotton to Somerset; (undated) Harleian MS. 7002, fol. 378. (B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the threat that, if such
a course were not taken, ‘turbulent spirits—of which Spain
wanteth not—might add some hurt to the ill affairs of
Ireland, or hindrance to the near affecting of the great
work now in hand;’ a threat which <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> transmits to
<span class='sc'>Somerset</span> without rebuke or comment.</p>

<p class='c029'>Early in 1615, <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> had an interview with <span class='sc'>Gondomar</span>
in relation to the progress of the marriage negotiation in
Spain. Of what passed at this interview we have no <i>detailed</i>
account other than that which was sent to the King of
Spain by his Ambassador. The way in which <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span>
name is introduced, and the singular misstatement that he
had the custody of ‘all the King’s archives,’ seem to imply
that <span class='sc'>Gondomar</span> had still but little knowledge of the
messenger now employed by <span class='sc'>James</span> and by <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>
to confer with him. Throughout, the reader will have to
bear in mind that the narrative is <span class='sc'>Gondomar’s</span>, and that
all the material points of it rest upon his sole authority.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1615. April 18.</div>

<p class='c029'>‘The King and the Earl of <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>,’ writes the
Ambassador, ‘have sent in great secrecy by Sir Robert
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span>—who is a gentleman greatly esteemed here, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>with whom the King has deposited all his archives—to tell
me what Sir John <span class='sc'>Digby</span> has written about the marriage
of the Infanta with this Prince. <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> informed me that
he was greatly pleased that the negotiation had been so
well received in Spain, because he desired its conclusion
and success. He enlarged upon the conveniencies of the
marriage, but said that the King considered <span class='sc'>Digby</span> not
to be a good negotiator, because he was a great friend of
the Archbishop of Canterbury, and of the Earl of <span class='sc'>Pembroke</span>,
who were of the Puritan faction, and was in
correspondence with them.’... ‘In order to make a
beginning,’ continued <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, as <span class='sc'>Gondomar</span> reports his
conversation, ‘the King must beg your Majesty to answer
three questions: (1.) “Does your Majesty believe that with
a safe conscience you can negotiate this marriage?” (2.) “Is
your Majesty sincerely desirous to conclude it, upon conditions
suitable to both parties?” (3.) “Will your Majesty
abstain from asking anything, in matters of Religion,
which would compel him to do that which he cannot do
without risking his life and his kingdom; contenting yourself
with trusting that he will be able to settle matters
quietly?”
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Gardiner Transcripts of Simancas MSS.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When an answer is given to these questions he
will consider the matter as settled, and will immediately
give a commission to the Earl of Somerset to arrange the
points with me.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>See also S. R. Gardiner, in <i>Letters of Gondomar, giving an Account of the affair of the Earl of Somerset</i>; (<i>Archæologia</i>, vol. xli.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> is held here, by
many, to be a Puritan, but he told me that he was a
Catholic, and gave me many reasons why no man of sense
could be anything else.’ He afterwards adds: ‘Sir Robert
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, who has treated with me in this business, tells me
that after the marriage is agreed upon, [and] before the
Infanta arrives in England, matters of Religion will be in
a much improved condition.’ The writer of this remarkable
despatch, it may be well to mention, had asserted with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>equal roundness, but a few months before, that <span class='sc'>James</span>
himself had said, at the dinner-table: ‘I have no doubt
that the Roman Catholic Church is the true Church.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Simancas MSS. 2590, 10 (Gardiner Transcripts).</div>

<p class='c029'>Nor is it unimportant, as bearing on the <i>degree</i> of credibility
to be assigned to <span class='sc'>Gondomar’s</span> despatches, when they
chance to be uncorroborated,—to remark that a despatch
addressed by him to the Duke of <span class='sc'>Lerma</span>, in November,
contains an express contradiction of an assertion addressed
to <span class='sc'>Philip</span>, in the preceding April. To the King, as we
have just seen, he narrates <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> communication of
despatches written by <span class='sc'>Digby</span>. To the Minister he writes,
six months later, that ‘a traitor had given information’
against <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, for communicating Papers of State to the
Spanish Ambassador, and that the charge is ‘false.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Simancas MS. 2534, 61 (Gardiner Transcripts).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Discrepancies
like this (howsoever easily explained, or explainable)
suffice to show that <span class='sc'>Gondomar’s</span> testimony, when
unsupported, needs to be read with caution; and of such
discrepancies there are many. Consummate as he was in
diplomatic ability of several kinds, this able statesman was
nevertheless loose (and sometimes reckless) in assertion. He
was very credulous when he listened to welcome news.
It is impossible to study his correspondence without perceiving
that to him, as to so many other men, the wish
was often father of the thought.</p>

<p class='c029'>On the 22nd of June, Sir Robert paid another visit to
<span class='sc'>Gondomar</span>. He told me, says the Ambassador, that the
King’s hesitations had been overcome; that <span class='sc'>James</span> was
now willing to negotiate on the basis of the Spanish articles,
with some slight modifications; that Somerset had taken
his stand upon the match with Spain, had won the co-operation
of the Duke of Lennox, and was now willing to stake
his fortunes on the issue. Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, adds <span class='sc'>Gondomar</span>,
‘assured me of his own satisfaction at the turn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>which things had taken, as he had no more ardent wish
than to live and die an avowed Catholic, like his fathers and
ancestors.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c030'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Whereupon I embraced him, and said that
God would guide.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Thus far, I have, advisedly, followed a Spanish account
of English conversations. Although believing that there
exists, already ample, evidence (both in our own archives
and elsewhere) for bringing home to the Count of <span class='sc'>Gondomar</span>
wilful misstatements of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Sir Robert Cotton’s Account of the first interview with Count Gondomar.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
fact—in the despatches which
he was wont to write from London—as well as very pardonable
misapprehensions of the talk which he reports, I have
preferred to put before the reader the Ambassador’s own
story in its Spanish integrity.</p>

<p class='c029'>The mere fact, indeed, that an English historian<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c030'><sup>[7]</sup></a>, deservedly
esteemed for his acute and painstaking research, as
well as for his eminent abilities, has honoured <span class='sc'>Gondomar’s</span>
story by endorsing it, is warrant enough for citing these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>despatches as they stand. But they have now to be compared
with another account of the same transaction given by
authority of Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> himself. It was given
upon a memorable occasion. The place was the Painted
Chamber in the Palace of Westminster. The hearers were
the assembled Lords and Commons of the Realm.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c030'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c029'>The Spaniard, it seems, was far, indeed, from holding—as
he says that he held—his first conference with <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>either in his own ambassadorial lodging, or upon credentials
given in the name and by the command of King
<span class='sc'>James</span>. That <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> sought him he suggests, by implication.
That the visit, in which the ground was broken, was
made at the King’s instance, he states circumstantially.
Both the suggestion and the assertion are false.</p>

<p class='c029'>As the reader has seen, Sir Robert’s openness in exhibiting
his library and his antiquities was matter of public
notoriety.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1614. February.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Profiting by that well-known facility of access,
the Spanish Ambassador presented himself at Cotton House
in the guise of a virtuoso. ‘Do me the favour—with your
wonted benevolence to strangers—to let me see your
Museum.’ With some such words as these, <span class='sc'>Gondomar</span>
volunteered his first visit; led the conversation, by and bye,
to politics; found that <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> was not amongst the
fanatical and undiscriminating enemies of Spain at all
price—outspoken, as he had been, from the first, in his
assertion both of the wisdom and of the duty of England
to protect the Netherlanders; showed him certain letters
or papers (not now to be identified, it appears), and in that
way produced an impression on <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> mind which led
him to confer with <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>, and eventually with the
King. So much is certain. Unfortunately, the speeches
at the famous ‘Conference’ on the Spanish Treaty, in 1624,
are reported in the most fragmentary way imaginable.
The reporter gives mere hints, where the reader anxiously
looks for details. Their present value lies in the conclusive
reasons which notwithstanding the lacunæ—they supply for
weighing, with many grains of caution, the accusations of
an enemy of England against an English statesman—whensoever
it chances that those accusations are uncorroborated.
King <span class='sc'>James</span> himself (it may here be added), when
looking back at this mysterious transaction some years later,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>and in one of his Anti-Spanish moods—said to Sir Robert:
‘The Spaniard is a juggling jack. I believe he forged
those letters;’ alluding, as the context suggests, to the
papers—whatever they were—which <span class='sc'>Gondomar</span> showed
to <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> at the outset of their intercourse, in order to
induce him to act as an intermediary between himself and
the Earl of <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>.</p>

<p class='c035'>At this time, the ground was already trembling beneath
<span class='sc'>Somerset’s</span> feet, though he little suspected the source of his
real danger. He knew, ere long, that an attempt would be
made to charge him with embezzling jewels of the Crown.
In connection with this charge there was a State secret, in
which Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> was a participant with <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>,
and with the King himself. And a secret it has remained.
Such jewels, it is plain, were in <span class='sc'>Somerset’s</span> hands, and by
him were transferred to those of <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>. Few persons
who have had occasion to look closely into the surviving
documents and correspondence which bear upon the subsequent
and famous trials for the murder of <span class='sc'>Overbury</span>, will
be likely to doubt that the secret was one among those ‘alien
matters’ of which <span class='sc'>Somerset</span> was so urgently and so repeatedly
adjured and warned, by <span class='sc'>James’s</span> emissaries, to avoid
all mention, should he still persist (despite the royal,
repeated, and almost passionate, entreaties with which he
was beset) in putting himself upon his trial; instead of
pleading guilty, after his wife’s example, and trusting
implicitly to the royal mercy.</p>

<p class='c029'>For the purpose of warding off the lesser, but foreseen,
danger, <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> advised the Earl to take a step of which
the Crown lawyers made subsequent and very effective use,
in order to preclude all chance of his escape from the unforeseen
and greater danger.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1615. July.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
By Sir Robert’s recommendation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>he obtained from the King permission to have a pardon
drawn, in which, amongst other provisions, it was granted
that no account whatever should be exacted from <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>
at the royal exchequer; and to that pardon the King
directed the Chancellor to affix the Great Seal. The Seal,
however, was withheld, and a remarkable scene ensued in
the Council Chamber. There are extant two or three
narratives of the occurrence, which agree pretty well in
substance. Of these <span class='sc'>Gondomar’s</span> is the most graphic.
The incident took place on the 20th of August. The
despatch in which it is minutely described was written on
the 20th of October. There is reason to believe that the
Ambassador drew his information from an eye-witness of
what passed.</p>

<p class='c029'>‘As the King was about to leave the Council Board,’
writes <span class='sc'>Gondomar</span>, ‘<span class='sc'>Somerset</span> made to him a speech
which, as I was told, had been preconcerted between them.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The scene in the Council Chamber, respecting the Pardon drawn by Sir R. Cotton for Somerset.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He said that the malice of his enemies had forced him to
ask for a pardon; adduced arguments of his innocency;
and then besought the King to command the Chancellor
to declare at once what he had to allege against him, or
else to put the seal to the pardon.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1615. August.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The King, without
permitting anything to be spoken, said a great deal in
<span class='sc'>Somerset’s</span> praise; asserted that the Earl had acted rightly
in asking for a pardon, which it was a pleasure to himself
to grant—although the Earl would certainly stand in no
need of it in his days—on the Prince’s account, who was
then present.’ Here, writes <span class='sc'>Gondomar</span>, the King placed
his hand on the Prince’s shoulder, and added—‘That he
may not undo what I have done.’ Then, turning to the
Chancellor, the King ended with the words: ‘And so, my
Lord Chancellor, put the seal to it; for such is my will.’
The Chancellor, instead of obeying, threw himself on his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>knees, told the King that the pardon was so widely drawn
that it made <span class='sc'>Somerset</span> (as Lord Chamberlain) absolute
master of ‘jewels, hangings, tapestry, and of all that
the palace contained; seeing that no account was to be
demanded of him for anything.’ And then the Chancellor
added: ‘If your Majesty insists upon it, I entreat you
to grant me a pardon also for passing it; otherwise I cannot
do it.’ On this the King grew angry, and with the
words, ‘I order you to pass it, and you must pass it,’
left the Council Chamber. His departure in a rage, before
the pardon was sealed, gave <span class='sc'>Somerset’s</span> enemies another
opportunity by which they did not fail to profit. They
had the Queen on their side. On that very day, too, the
King set out on a progress, long before arranged. For the
time the matter dropped. Before the Ambassador of Spain
took up his pen to tell the story to his Court, <span class='sc'>Villiers</span>,
‘the new favourite,’ had begun to supplant his rival; so
that the same despatch which narrates the beginnings of the
fall of <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>, tells also of the first stage in the rapid
rise of <span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Second Pardon drawn by Cotton.</span> 1615, Sept.</div>

<p class='c029'>About a month after this wrangling at the Council
Board, <span class='sc'>Somerset</span> again advised with Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>
on the same subject.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Report of the Trial of the Earl of Somerset.</i> (MS. R. H.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span> recommended him to have
the Pardon renewed; saying to the Earl, ‘In respect you
have received some disgrace in the opinion of the world, in
having passed’ [<i>i. e.</i> missed] ‘that pardon which in the
summer you desired, and seeing there be many precedents
of larger pardons, I would have you get one after the largest
precedent; that so, by that addition, you may recover your
honour.’ Strangely as these closing words now sound, in
relation to such a matter, they seem to embody both the
feeling and the practice of the times.</p>

<p class='c029'>In another version of the proceedings at the trial of May,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>1616, <span class='sc'>Somerset</span> is represented as using in the course of
his defence these words: ‘To Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> I referred
the whole drawing and despatch of the Pardon.’ And
again: ‘I first sought the Pardon by the motion and persuasion
of Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, who told me in what dangers
great persons honoured with so many royal favours had
stood, in former times.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MS. Report of Trial (R. H.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Sir Robert’s own account of this
and of many correlative matters of a still graver sort
has come down to us only in garbled fragments and
extracts from his examinations, such as it suited the purposes
of the law-officers of the Crown to make use of,
after their fashion. The original documents were as carefully
suppressed, as <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> appearance in person at the
subsequent trial was effectually hindered. At that day it
was held to be an unanswerable reason for the non-appearance
of a witness,—whatever the weight of his testimony,—to
allege that he was regarded by the Crown as ‘a delinquent,’
and could not, therefore, be publicly questioned
upon ‘matters of State.’ There is little cause to marvel
that a scrutinising reader of the <i>State Trials</i> (in their
published form) is continually in doubt whether what he
reads ought to be regarded as sober history, or as wild
and, it may be, venomous romance.</p>

<p class='c035'>One other incident of 1615 needs to be noticed before we
proceed to the catastrophe of the Gondomar story.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1615. May 24.</div>

<p class='c029'>In May of this year Sir Robert wrote a letter to Prince
<span class='sc'>Charles</span>, which is notable for the contrasted advice, in
respect to warlike pursuits, which it proffers to the new
Prince, from that more famous advice which had but
recently been offered to his late brother.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Comp. MS. Cott. Cleop. F. vi, § 1. ‘<i>An Answer ... to certain military men, &amp;c.</i>, (April, 1609).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He had
lately found, he tells Prince <span class='sc'>Charles</span>, a very ancient volume
containing the principal passages of affairs between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>two kingdoms of England and France under the reigns of
King <span class='sc'>Henry the Third</span> and King <span class='sc'>Henry the Fifth</span>, and
had caused a friend of his to abstract from it the main
grounds of the claim of the Kings of England to the Crown
of France; translating the original Latin into English.
This he now dedicates to the Prince, ‘as a piece of
evidence concerning that title which, at the time when
God hath appointed, shall come unto you.’ He ends his
letter in a strain more than usually rhetorical:—‘This
title hath heretofore been pleaded in France, as well by
ordinary arguments of civil and common law, as also by
more sharp syllogisms of cannons in the field. There
have your noble ancestors, Kings of this realm, often
argued in arms; there have been their large chases; there,
their pleasant walks; there have they hewed honour out
of the sides of their enemies; there—in default of peaceable
justice—they have carried the cause by sentence of
the sword.

<div class='sidenote'>The King to Archbishop of Canterbury, &amp;c. <i>Domestic Corresp.</i> James I, vol. lxxxvi, § 16. (R. H.)</div>

<p class='c029'>The royal commission for the first examination of <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>
was issued on the 26th of October, 1615. Two months
afterwards he was committed to the custody of one of the
Aldermen of London. His library and papers were also
searched.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> accusation was that of having communicated
papers and secrets of State to the Spanish Ambassador.
He was subjected to repeated examinations, which (as we
have seen) are extant only in part. He maintained his
innocence of all intentional offence.

‘The King,’ he said,

His Majesty my fault was involuntary. I followed the
King’s instruction to the best of my belief and recollection.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>The examiners, however, were more intent by far on
extracting something from <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> that would tell against
<span class='sc'>Somerset</span>, than on the punishment of the fallen favourite’s
ally and agent. <span class='sc'>Coke</span>, in particular, was indefatigable in the
task. It was as congenial to him as was the study of
<span class='sc'>Bracton</span> or of <span class='sc'>Littleton</span>.</p>

<p class='c029'>What then must have been his delight when,—whilst attending
a sermon at Paul’s Cross,—word was brought to him

correspondence? The pending proceedings had stirred men’s
minds in city and suburb, as well as at Court. A London
merchant had been asked, a little while before, to take into
his charge a box of papers. The depositor was a woman
of the middle class, with whom his acquaintance was but
slight. At that time there was nothing in the incident to
excite suspicion. But, at a moment when strange rumours
were afloat, the depositor suddenly requested the return of
the deposit. The merchant bethought himself that the
circumstances now looked mysterious. If the papers should
chance to bear on matters of State, to have had any concern
with them, howsoever innocent, might be dangerous. He
carried the box to Sir Edward <span class='sc'>Coke’s</span> chambers. Not a
moment was lost in apprising the absent lawyer of the
incident. Such news was of more interest than the sermon.
Probably, the preacher had not finished his exordium,
before all the faculties of <span class='sc'>Coke</span> and of a fellow-commissioner
were bent on the letters which had passed between <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>
and <span class='sc'>Northampton</span>.</p>

<p class='c029'>If <span class='sc'>Gondomar</span> is to be believed, some secret papers
belonging to King <span class='sc'>James</span> himself were part of the precious
spoil.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c030'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>As usual, there are two accounts of the original secretor
of the papers so opportunely discovered. According to one
of them, the box was delivered by <span class='sc'>Somerset’s</span> own order
to the woman by whom it was carried to the London
merchant.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Cotton’s dealings with Somerset’s Correspondence.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1615.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
According to another, <span class='sc'>Somerset</span> entrusted the
papers to <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>; and the latter, anticipating the search
and sealing up of his library, gave them to a female
acquaintance with whom he thought they would remain in
safety, but whose own fears led her to shift their custody,
in her turn.</p>

<p class='c029'>That the letters which <span class='sc'>Northampton</span> had received from
<span class='sc'>Somerset</span>—containing, amongst many other things,
numerous references to the imprisonment of <span class='sc'>Overbury</span> in
the Tower—had been in Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> hands is
unquestioned. After <span class='sc'>Northampton’s</span> death, <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, to
use his own words, had been ‘permitted to peruse and
oversee all the writings, books, &amp;c. in the Earl’s study.’ In
the course of this examination he proceeds to say, ‘I had
collected thirty several letters of my Lord of <span class='sc'>Somerset</span> to
the Earl of Northampton, which, upon request, I delivered
to my Lord Treasurer [the Earl of <span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>,] who sent
them to the Earl of <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>.’ <span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>, it is to be
remembered, was <span class='sc'>Northampton’s</span> heir.</p>

<p class='c029'>Thus far, no charge rests upon <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> in relation to this
correspondence. What he did in disposing of <span class='sc'>Somerset’s</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>letters was done by order of the representatives of their
deceased owner. It is far otherwise with respect to their
treatment after they had repassed, by <span class='sc'>Suffolk’s</span> gift, into
the hands of <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>, their writer.</p>

<p class='c029'>The letters were undated. That they should be so was
in accordance with the practice of a majority of the letter-writers
of the time—as students of history know to their
sorrow.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Extracts of Examinations, &amp;c. (R. H.).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When suspicion was aroused and inquiry commenced
about the real cause of <span class='sc'>Overbury’s</span> death, <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span>
advice was sought by <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>. He told me, says
<span class='sc'>Somerset</span> himself: ‘These letters of yours may be dated,
so as may clear you of all imputation.’ Did he mean
that the dates might be forged, and so be made to bear
false witness? Or did he mean that, by putting their true
dates to the letters, their contents would exculpate an
innocent man? To these questions there is absolutely no
answer, save the presumptive answer of character.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c030'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Whatever may be our estimate of the difficulty attending
on the admission of such exculpation as that, in respect of a
charge which amounts (in substance) to participation, after
the fact, in the crime of murder, there is really now no
alternative. That Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> put dates to <span class='sc'>Somerset’s</span>
undated letters is certain. It was found to be absolutely
impossible, after desperate effort, to prove that the
dates were false. It is alike impossible to prove that they
are true. These dates are in <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> own hand, without
any attempt to disguise it.</p>

<p class='c029'>Upon the hypothesis of <span class='sc'>Somerset’s</span> guilt, the question
is beset with as much difficulty, as upon the hypothesis of
his innocence. By procuring <span class='sc'>Overbury’s</span> imprisonment—with
whatever motive, or beneath whatever influence—<span class='sc'>Somerset</span>
had brought himself under inevitable suspicion
of complicity in the ultimate result of that imprisonment.
He was already within the web. His struggles made it
only the more tangled.</p>

<p class='c029'>Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> remained in custody until the middle
of the year 1616. He was effectually prevented from
appearing in May of that year as a witness at his friend’s
trial.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Domestic Corresp.</i> James I, vol. lxxxvii, f. 67 (R. H.).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He was himself put to no form of trial whatever. But
he had to purchase his pardon at the price of five hundred
pounds. It received the Great Seal on the 16th July.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Bacon to Villiers, Feb. 1; and April 18; 1616.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Remembering <span class='sc'>Bacon’s</span> share in each stage of the proceedings
against <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>, and the lavishness of his professions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>to <span class='sc'>Villiers</span> of the extreme delight he felt in
following the lead of the new favourite throughout every
step of the prosecution of the old one, it is suggestive to
note that the framers, five years afterwards, of a pardon for
the Lord Chancellor <span class='sc'>Bacon</span> were directed to follow the
precedent of the pardon granted in July 1616 to Sir Robert
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span>.</p>

<p class='c029'>Nor is it of less interest to observe that, to some of Sir
Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> closest friends, it seemed—at the moment
when every part of the matter was fresh in men’s minds—that
it was much more needful for him to exonerate himself
from a suspicion of having stood beside <span class='sc'>Somerset</span> too lukewarmly,
than to clear himself from the charge of committing
a forgery in order to cloke a murder. Very
significant, for example, are the words of one of those friends
which I find in a letter addressed to <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> on the very
day on which his pardon passed the Great Seal:—‘If I
say I rejoice and gratulate to you your return to your own
house, as I did lament your captivity,&#160;... it will easily be
credited.... The unsureness of this collusive world, and
the danger of great friendships, you have already felt; and
may truly say, with holy <span class='sc'>David</span>, <i>Nolite fidere in principibus</i>....
As I hear, you have begun to make good use of it, by
receiving to you your Lady which God himself had knit
unto you. It is a piety for which you are commended.
And, were it not for one thing I should think my comfort
in you were complete.... <i>It is said you were not sufficiently
sincere to your most trusting friend, the pitied Earl.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>E. Bolton to Sir R. Cotton; Cott. MS. Julius C., iii, fol. 32. (B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Though
I hold this a slander, yet being not able to make particular
defences, I opposed my general protestation against it as an
injury to my friend.</i> Yet wanting apt countermines to
meet with those close works by which some seek to blow up
a breach into your honour, I was not a little afflicted....
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>I leave the arming of me in this cause to your own
pleasure.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The caution as to the danger of the friendships of
grandees and great favourites was one which <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> took
to heart. In the years to come he had occasionally to give
critical advice, in critical junctures. But, in the true sense
of the words, he learnt, at last, not to put his trust in
Princes. Long before his acquaintance with <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>
and his private conferences with <span class='sc'>James</span>, a very true and
dear friend had noted a dangerous proclivity in Sir Robert’s
character.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Arthur Agarde to Sir R. Cotton: Cott. MS. Julius C., iii, fol. 1.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It prompted, by way of counsel, the words:
‘Be yourself; and no man’s creature; but [only] God’s.
And so He will prosper all your designs, both to his glory
and your good.’</p>

<p class='c029'>That ply had been taken too deeply, however, to be very
easily smoothed out. In the years to come Sir Robert
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span> approached—more than once, perhaps—the brink
of the old peril. As <span class='sc'>Buckingham</span> clomb higher and higher,
and busied himself with many transactions of the nature of
which he had but a very insecure mental grasp, he felt his
need of the counsels of experienced men. He made occasional
advances to <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, amongst others. They were
met; and not always so warily, as might now have been
expected.</p>

<p class='c029'>But against the danger which over-confiding intercourse
with too-powerful courtiers was sure to bring in its train,
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span> found a better safeguard in wounded self-esteem,
than even in dearbought experience. He soon saw that in
<span class='sc'>Buckingham’s</span> character there was at least as much of
vacillation as of versatility. The famous lines which describe
the son as</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c033'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A man so various, that he seem’d to be</div>
      <div class='line'>Not one, but all mankind’s epitome,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>would have a spice of truth if applied to the father. But
their applicability is only partial; whereas the lines which
follow are almost as true—a single word excepted—of
the first Duke of Buckingham as they were of the
second—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c033'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Stiff in opinions; often in the wrong;</div>
      <div class='line'>He’s everything by starts, and nothing long.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>When Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> perceived that James’s new
favourite would listen, in the morning, to grave advice on a
grave subject, and affirm his resolution to act upon it; and
yet, in the afternoon suffer himself to be carried from his purpose
by the silly jests or malicious suggestions of youngsters
and sycophants, unacquainted with affairs and often reckless
of consequences, he saw the wisdom of standing somewhat
aloof. He rarely, however, refused his advice, when
it was asked. In regard to matters of naval administration,—the
authoritative value of his opinion on which
was now everywhere recognised, save in the dockyards and
their dependencies,—he gave it with especial willingness.
But henceforward, to use <span class='sc'>Agarde’s</span> words, he was ‘no
man’s creature.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Five years passed on, marked by events which stirred
England to its core, but to Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> they were
years of comparative quiet. He was, indeed, very far from
being a careless bystander. He observed much, and learnt
much.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Growth of Cotton’s Literary and Public Correspondence.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Had it not been for the lessons which those publicly
eventful years impressed on his receptive mind, he
might have gone to his grave with no other reputation
than that of a profound antiquary, and the Founder of the
Cottonian Library.</p>

<p class='c029'>Meanwhile, his pen worked as hard in the service of
scholars, both at home and abroad, as though he had been a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>busy proof-reader in a leading printing-office. He supplied,
at the same time, on the right hand and on the left, precedents
and formulæ, with a diligence and readiness which would
have won both fame and fortune for a long-accustomed
conveyancer. <span class='sc'>Camden</span> consults him, continually, for help
in his historical labours. Ben <span class='sc'>Jonson</span> puts questions to

The Earl of

increasing them. And, anon, there comes to Sir Robert,
from a third great peer, the second of the Cecil Earls of
Salisbury, an entreaty—expressed in terms so urgent that
one might call it a supplication—‘Permit me, I pray you,
to see my Lord of <span class='sc'>Northampton’s</span> letters....
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Salisbury to Cotton, in MS. Cott., Julius C., iii.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
I will
return them unread, and unseen, by anybody,’ save himself.
And then the Secretary of State writes to him in an impetuous
hurry which made his letter scarcely legible:—‘If
you be not here’ [<i>i. e.</i> at the Council Chamber] ‘with those
precedents for which there is present use, we are all
undone.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MS. Cott., Julius C., iii, fol. 57.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For His Majesty doth so chide, that I dare not
come in his sight.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Along with this busy correspondence—of which, in these
brief sentences I have given the reader but a very inadequate
and scanty sample—the surviving records of these
years of comparative retirement supply us with abundant
notices of the growth and of the sources, from time to time,
of the Cottonian Library. It would be no unwelcome task
to tell that story at length. It would, indeed, be but the
paying, in very humble coin, of a debt of gratitude to a
liberal benefactor. But within the compass of these pages
so many careers have to be narrated that the due proportions
of some of them—and even of one so interesting as
<span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span>—must needs be closely shorn. On this point
it must, for the present, suffice to say that the acquisition
of many Cottonian State Papers, and of such as carry on
their face the most irrefragable marks of former official
ownership, can be distinctly traced. The assertion is no
hasty or inconsiderate one. It is founded on an acquaintance
with the Cottonian MSS., which is now, I fear, thirty
years old, and on the strength of which (when reading
some recent assaults on the fair fame of their Collector), I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>have been tempted to put certain well-known lines into Sir
Robert’s mouth:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c033'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in24'>If I am</div>
      <div class='line'>Traduced by o’er hasty tongues—which neither know</div>
      <div class='line'>My faculties nor person, yet will be</div>
      <div class='line'>The chroniclers of my doing—let me say</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake</div>
      <div class='line'>That virtue must go through.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>Were it not, however, for one pregnant circumstance in
Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> subsequent life, all this would have
but a very meager attractiveness for nineteenth-century
readers. The story of the growth of a great library has
its charm, but the sphere of potency is of small dimension.
Few but those who are themselves imbued with a spice of
literary antiquarianism ever enter within the narrow circle.
Just in like manner, that active literary and political correspondence—spreading
from Exeter to Durham, and from
Venice to Copenhagen—would nowadays have but a
slender interest for anybody (not belonging to the scorned
fraternity of Oldbuck and Dryasdust), were it not for that
great war between King and Parliament, Cavalier and
Roundhead, of which, in one sense, <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> lived only
long enough to see the gathering of forces, and the early
skirmishes, but in which, nevertheless, he played a part
second only to that played by <span class='sc'>Eliot</span> and by <span class='sc'>Pym</span>. His
close connection with the Parliamentarian leaders of 1625–1629
lifts the whole story of the man out of the petty
circuit of mere ‘curiosities of literature,’ into the broad
arena of the hard-won liberties of England.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Cotton’s alliance with the Parliamentarian chiefs.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>All students of the deeds done in that arena now know—and
their knowledge is in no slight degree due to the
persistent labours of a living writer—that the battle of the
‘Petition of Right’ was even a greater battle than Naseby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>or Marston Moor. They know that the marshalling of the
forces which, at a period antecedent to that famous Petition,
succeeded in winning a safe place on ‘the fleshy tables’ of
the hearts of Englishmen for those political immunities it
embodied—after the first written record had been vainly
torn from the Council Book—was a feat of arms not less brilliant,
in its way, than was that arraying of Ironsides, on much
later days of the long strife, which resulted in ‘Darwen
stream with blood of Scots imbued,’ and placed Worcester’s
laureat wreath on the brow of <span class='sc'>Cromwell</span>. There are many
senses in which we have all of us (or nearly all) learnt to
see the truth of the familiar words, ‘Peace hath her victories,
not less renown’d than War,’ but in no sense have
those words a deeper truth than when we simply invert
<span class='sc'>Milton’s</span> own application of them. By him they were
pointed at something yet to be done, and which, as he
hoped, might be done by <span class='sc'>Cromwell</span>. Nowadays, the historian
has good ground to point them at an earlier victory,
won when the great soldier was but looking on at the
parliamentary contest, which he could not much advance,
and might very possibly have seriously impeded. The one
thing which has transmuted Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> from the
status of a dead antiquary into that of a living English
worthy, is his close fellowship with <span class='sc'>Eliot</span>, <span class='sc'>Rudyard</span>, and
<span class='sc'>Pym</span>. His rights to a place amongst our national worthies
is due—more than all else—to the fact that the services
which he rendered in that strife of heroes were services
which one man, and only one, throughout broad England
had made himself capable of rendering. <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> could no
more have led the parliamentary phalanx, than he could
have led the Ironsides. To stir men’s minds as <span class='sc'>Eliot</span> or
<span class='sc'>Pym</span> could stir them was about as much in his power as it
was to have invented logarithms, or to have written ‘<i>Lear</i>.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>But if he could not command the army, he could furnish the
arsenal. At that day and under the then circumstances
that service was priceless.</p>

<p class='c029'>Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> best and most memorable parliamentary
service was rendered under <span class='sc'>Charles</span>; not under
<span class='sc'>James</span>. But there is one incident in his public career
which occurred just before the change in the wearers of the
Crown that has a claim to mention, even in so brief a
memoir as this.</p>

<p class='c029'>Among the revenges wrought by the ‘whirligigs of time’
before <span class='sc'>James</span> went to his grave, was the necessity laid upon
him to direct a search for precedents how best to put
a mark of disgrace on a Spanish Ambassador for misconduct
in his office. The man selected by the Duke of Buckingham
to make the search, and to report upon it, was Sir
Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>. Some weeks before he had been chosen to
draw up, in the name of both Houses of Parliament, a
formal address to the King for the rupture of the Spanish
match.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The search for precedents against Ambassadors.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>When <span class='sc'>Buckingham</span> made that famous speech at the
Conference of Lords and Commons on the relations between
England and Spain, to which <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> well-known
<i>Remonstrance of the treaties of Amity and Marriage of the
Houses of Austria and Spain with the Kings of England</i>,<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c030'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
was to serve as a preface, he spoke with considerable
force and incisiveness.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1624. 27 April.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
His arguments were not hampered
by many anxieties about consistency with his own antecedents.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>His words were chosen with a view to clinch his
arguments to English minds rather than to spare Spanish
susceptibilities. The ambassadors—there were then, I
think, two of them—were furious at a degree of plain-speaking
to which they had been little accustomed. They
appealed to the King. They knew that the versatile
favourite, once loved, was now dreaded. They tried to work
on the King’s cowardice. The Duke, they told His Majesty,
had plotted the calling of Parliament expressly to have a
sure tool with which to keep him in control, should he prove
refractory to the joint schemes of the Duke and Prince
<span class='sc'>Charles</span>. ‘They will confine your Majesty’s sacred
person,’ said they, ‘to some place of pleasure, and transfer
the regal power upon the Prince.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The framing of such an accusation, writes Sir Robert, in
the Report which he addressed to <span class='sc'>Buckingham</span> on ‘<i>Proceedings
against Ambassadors have miscarried themselves</i>,’
would, by the laws of the realm, amount to High
Treason, had it been made by a subject.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Relation of Proceedings, &amp;c.</i>; MS. <span class='sc'>Lansd.</span>, 811, ff. 133–139.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He then adduces
a long string of precedents for the treatment of offending
envoys; advises that the Spaniards should first be immediately
confined to their own abode; and should then, by
the Speakers of both Houses of Parliament, in person, be
exhorted and required to ‘make a fair discovery of the
ground that led them so to inform the King.’</p>

<p class='c029'>If, says Sir Robert, they refuse—‘as I believe they will’—then
are they authors of the scandal, and His Majesty
should be addressed to send a ‘letter of complaint to the
King of Spain, requiring justice to be done according to the
law of nations, which claim should the King of Spain refuse,
the refusal would amount to a declaration of war.’
This advice was given by <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> to the Duke on the 27th
of April, 1624. Its author’s momentary favour with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>favourite of the now fast-rising sun was destined (as we shall
see presently) to be of extremely brief duration.</p>

<p class='c029'>Pen-service of this sort was eminently congenial with
Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> powers. To his vast knowledge of
precedents he added much acumen and just insight in
their application. Though never admitted to the Privy
Council as a sworn councillor of the Crown, his service as
an adviser on several great emergencies was conspicuous.</p>

<p class='c035'>And it did not stand alone. Small as were his natural
gifts for oratory, <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> earnestness in the strife of
politics prompted him, more than once, to put aside
his own sense of his disadvantages, and to endeavour himself
to strike a good blow, with the weapons which he knew
so well how to choose for others.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Cotton’s Speech in the Parliament at Oxford.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
On one of these occasions
he prepared a speech which proved very effective.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1625. 10 August.</div>

<p class='c029'>Curiously enough, whilst the best contemporary reports
of that speech agree amongst themselves in substance;
they differ as to the name of the speaker by whom it was
actually uttered within the walls of the House of Commons.
Internal evidence and external authority are also agreed
that the speech, if not spoken, was at all events prepared
by Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>. On that point, all parties coincide.
But according to one account, he both wrote and uttered
it. According to another, he wrote it; but was prevented
from the intended delivery,—either by an accidental
absence from the House, or by some inward and unwaivable
misgiving which led him at the eleventh hour
to hand over the task to the able and well-accustomed
tongue of his comrade <span class='sc'>Eliot</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Cotton’s? or Eliot’s?</span></div>

<p class='c029'>If we turn, for help—in our strait—to the admirable
biography of <span class='sc'>Eliot</span>, by Mr. <span class='sc'>Forster</span>, we shall find that its
author rather accepts the doubt, than solves it. Inclining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>to the opinion that Sir John <span class='sc'>Eliot</span> was the actual utterer,
he thinks nevertheless that the best course is to ‘let the
speech stand double and inseparable; a memorial of a fast
friendship.’ It was the friendship, I may add, of two statesmen
who fought a good fight, side by side; until one of
them was violently torn out of the arena, and thrust into a
dungeon, in the hope that slow disease might unstring the
eloquent tongue which honours could not bribe, and terrors
could not silence.</p>

<p class='c029'>In Sir Robert’s posthumous tracts (as they were published
by James <span class='sc'>Howell</span>) this speech has been printed as
unquestionably spoken by him who wrote it. But that
publication—as I have had occasion to show already, in
relation to the ‘<i>Twenty-four Arguments</i>’—carries no grain
of authority. Spoken or simply composed by its author,
the speech is alike memorable in English history, and in
the personal life of the man himself.</p>

<p class='c029'>The existence of the plague in London had led to the
adjournment of the first Parliament of King <span class='sc'>Charles</span> to
Oxford. It was there, and on the 10th of August, 1625,
that the speech which—whether it came from the lips of
John <span class='sc'>Eliot</span> or of Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>—made a deep impression
on the House, was spoken. It gave the key-note to not a
few speeches of a subsequent date, and it contains passages
which, in the event, came to have on their face something
of the stamp of prophecy.</p>

<p class='c029'>Retrenchment in expenditure,—Parliamentary curb on
Royal favourites,—No trust of a transcendent power to
any one Minister,—Less lavishness in the bestowal of
honours and dignities won by suit, or purchase, rather
than by public meed,—Wary distrust of Spain,—Abolition
of unjust monopolies and oppressive imposts;—these are
amongst the earnest counsels which (whether it were as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>writer, or as speaker) Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> impressed on his
fellow-members in that memorable sitting at Oxford. Both
the pith and the sting of the Speech may be found in its
concluding words: ‘His Majesty hath&#160;... wise, religious,
and worthy servants.... In loyal duty, we offer our
humble desires that he would be pleased to advise with
them <i>together;&#160;... not with young and single counsel</i>.’
Well would it have been for <span class='sc'>Charles</span>, had he taken those
simple words to heart, in good time.</p>

<p class='c029'>To us, and now, there is a special interest in an incidental
passage of this speech which relates to <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>.
The reader has seen how Count <span class='sc'>Gondomar’s</span> secret testimony—just
disinterred from Simancas—against <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>,
as well as against <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, has recently been dealt with by
an eminent historian.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>(See, also, heretofore, the foot-note to p. 73.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is worth our while to remember
some other words on that subject spoken publicly in the
Parliament at Oxford almost two centuries and a half agone.
They were spoken in the ears of men whose eyes had
looked with keen scrutiny into the Spanish envoy as well
as into the English minister. <span class='sc'>Somerset</span> was still living.
Men who then sat in the Parliament Chamber knew every
incident in his official life, and not a few incidents in his
private life, as well as every charge by which—publicly or
privately—he had been infamed. They knew, exactly,
Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> position towards the fallen minister.
If we choose to suppose that <span class='sc'>Eliot</span> was now speaking
what <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> wrote, the inference is unchanged. To those
listeners Sir John and Sir Robert were known to be politically
‘double and inseparable.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Cotton’s Eulogy on Lord Somerset’s policy</span> (August, 1625).</div>

<p class='c029'>The facts being so, what is the course taken by the
speaker when he finds occasion to remind the House of
things that happened when ‘My Lord of Somerset stood
in state of grace, and had the trust of the Signet Seal?’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Does he take a line of apology and use words of extenuation?
Not a whit. In the presence of some of the wisest
and ablest of English statesmen, he eulogises <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>
as an honest and unselfish minister of the Crown. He
asserts, that the Earl had discovered ‘the double dealings’
of Spanish emissaries, and the dangers of the Spanish
alliance; and had made some progress in dissuading even
King <span class='sc'>James</span> from putting faith in Spaniards. Then, winding
up this episode, in order to pass to the topic of the
hour, <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> says: ‘Thus stood the effect of <span class='sc'>Somerset’s</span>
power with His Majesty, when the clouds of his misfortune
fell upon him. What future advisers led to we may well
remember.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MS. <span class='sc'>Lansd.</span>,<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c030'><sup>[12]</sup></a> 491, fol. 195.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The marriage with Spain was renewed;
<span class='sc'>Gondomar</span> declared an honest man; Popery heartened;
His Majesty’s forces in the Palatinate withdrawn; His
Highness’s children stripped of their patrimony; our old
and fast allies disheartened; and the King our now master
exposed to so great a peril as no wise and faithful counsel
would ever have advised.’</p>

<p class='c035'>At Court, speech such as this was deeply resented, instead
of being turned to profit. A curious little incident which
occurred at the Coronation of <span class='sc'>Charles</span> in the next winter
testifies, characteristically, to the effect which it produced
on the minds both of the new King and of his favourite.</p>

<p class='c035'>At the date of that ceremony, Sir Robert’s close political
connection with the future Parliamentary chiefs was but in
its infancy. His views of public policy were fast ripening,
and had borne fruit. His private friendships were more and
more shaping themselves into accordance with his tendencies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>in politics. Amongst those whose intimacy he cultivated—besides
that of <span class='sc'>Eliot</span> and others who have been mentioned
already—were Symonds <span class='sc'>D’Ewes</span>, and John <span class='sc'>Selden</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Friends and Hospitalities.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It
was at <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> hospitable table, in Old Palace Yard, that
the two men last named first made acquaintance with each
other. Both were scholars; both were strongly imbued
with the true antiquarian tinge; both had an extensive
acquaintance with the black-letter lore of jurisprudence, as
well as with the more elegant branches of archæology; and
both, up to a certain point, had common aims in public
life; yet they did not draw very near together. <span class='sc'>Selden’s</span>
more robust mind, and his wider sympathies, shocked some
of the puritanic nicenesses of <span class='sc'>D’Ewes</span>. Precisely the
same remark would hold good of the relations between
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span> and <span class='sc'>D’Ewes</span>. But a certain geniality of manners
in Sir Robert, combined with his grandee-like openness of
hand and mind, attracted his fellow-baronet in a degree
which went some way towards vanquishing <span class='sc'>D’Ewes’</span> most
ingrained scruples.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Harl. MS., as above.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘I had much more familiarity with
Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, than with Master <span class='sc'>Selden</span>,’ jots down
Sir Symonds in his Autobiographic <i>Diary</i>, and then he
adds: ‘<span class='sc'>Selden</span> being a man exceedingly puffed up with the
apprehension of his own abilities.’ That last sentence,—as
the reader, perhaps, will agree with me in thinking,—may
possibly tell a more veracious tale of the writer, than
of the man whom it reproves.</p>

<p class='c029'>Be that as it may, the dining-room in Old Palace Yard
witnessed frequent meetings of many groups of visitors of
whose tabletalk it would be delightful could we find as
good a record as we have of the tabletalk in Bolt Court, or
at Streatham Park; or even as we have of almost contemporary
talk around the board at Hawthornden. Glorious
old Ben himself was a frequent guest at Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>table. Until late in <span class='sc'>James’</span> reign, <span class='sc'>Camden</span>, when his
growing infirmities permitted him to journey up from
Chislehurst, would still be seen there, now and again.
During the rare sessions of Parliament, many a famous
member, as he left the House of Commons, would join
the circle. And the high discourse about Greeks and
Romans, about poetry and archæology, would be pleasantly
varied, by the newest themes of politics, by occasional
threnodies on the exorbitant power of court minions, but
also by occasional and glowing anticipations of a better time
to come.</p>

<p class='c029'>At one of these festive meetings, occurring not long
before the Coronation of <span class='sc'>Charles the First</span>, the talk
seems to have turned on the coming solemnity.
The plague
at this time was still in London, though it was fast abating.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Cotton and the Coronation of Charles I.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
That circumstance was to abridge the ceremonies, in order
to permit the Court to leave Westminster more quickly;
but it was known that great attention had been given by
the King, personally, when framing the programme, to
the strict observance of ancient forms. <span class='sc'>D’Ewes</span> was one
of Sir Robert’s guests. Like his host, he had a great love
for sight-seeing on public occasions. And they would both
anticipate a special pleasure in witnessing the revival of
certain coronation observances which had been pretermitted
during two centuries. In regard to the coronation
oath <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> had been consulted, and he expected to be
present, carrying in his hand his own famous copy of the
Gospels known as the ‘<i>Evangeliary of King Ethelstan</i>.’
It was also expected that the watergate of Cotton House
would be the King’s landing-place, and that he would cross
the garden in order that he might enter the Palace more
conveniently than he could from its usual stairs, then under
repair, or in need of it. Sir Robert invited <span class='sc'>D’Ewes</span>, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>other of his guests—not privileged to claim places in Westminster
Abbey on the great occasion—that at least they
might see their new sovereign, as he passed to take his
crown.</p>

<p class='c029'>When the morning came <span class='sc'>D’Ewes</span> was early in his visit,
but, he found Cotton House already filled with ladies. The
Earl Marshal had decorated the stairs to the river and the
watergate very handsomely. Sir Robert had done his part
by decorating his windows, and his garden, more handsomely
still. But to the chagrin alike of the fair spectators
and of their host, as they were standing, in all their
bravery, from watergate to housedoor, to do respectful
obeisance, the royal barge, by the King’s own commandment—given
at the moment, but pre-arranged by <span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>—was
urged onward. To our amazement, writes
Sir Symonds, ‘we saw the King’s barge pass to the
ordinary stairs, belonging to the backyard of the Palace,
where the landing was dirty&#160;... and the incommodity was
increased by the royal barge dashing into the ground and
sticking fast, before it touched the causeway.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>D’Ewes; in Harl. MS., 646, as before.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
His Majesty,
followed by the Favourite, had to leap across the
mud,—certainly an unusual incident in a coronation show.</p>

<p class='c029'>When <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>—swallowing the mortification which he
must have felt, on behalf of his bevy of fair visitors, if not
on his own—presently showed himself in the Abbey, bearing
the <i>Evangeliary</i>, he and it were contemptuously thrust
aside.</p>

<p class='c029'>As a straw tells the turn of the wind, this trivial incident
points to a policy. The insults both within the
Abbey and without, had been planned, by the King and
Duke, in order to mark the royal indignation at the close
fellowship of <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> with <span class='sc'>Eliot</span> and the other Parliamentary
leaders. That the insults might be the more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>keenly felt, the Earl Marshal was left in ignorance of the
plan. It is a help to the truthful portraiture of <span class='sc'>Charles</span>,
as well as to that of <span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>, to note that to insult a
group of English ladies was no drawback to the pleasure of
putting a marked affront upon a political opponent. Perhaps,
it increased the zest, from the probable near relationship
of some among them to the offender.</p>

<p class='c029'>But it is more important to note that another and graver
intention in respect to Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> had been already
formed. It was in contemplation to do, in 1626, what was
not really done until 1629.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Mede to Stuteville; MS. Harl., 383, 18 April, 1626.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>Buckingham</span> had advised the
King to put the royal seals on the Cottonian Library.
That done, he thought, there would surely be an end to the
communication of formidable precedents for parliamentary
warfare. More wary counsellors however interposed with
wiser advice. A fitting pretext was lacking. Slenderness
in the pretext would be no serious obstacle to action. But
some excuse there must be. The project, though abandoned
for the time, will be seen to have its value when
considering, presently, the strange story which is told, in
the Privy Council Book, of the ‘<i>Proposition to bridle the
impertinency of Parliaments</i>,’ and when narrating the
sequel of that high-handed act of power, which brought
<span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> head—as yet scarcely gray—with sorrow to the
grave.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Advice to Privy Council on Change of Coinage.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Although, thus early in the reign of <span class='sc'>Charles</span>, a court
insult was inflicted upon Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, after a fashion
the extreme silliness of which rather serves to set off the
intended malignity than to cloke it, only a few months
passed before his advice was called for in presence of the
Council Board, on an important question of home policy.
The question raised was that of an alteration of the coinage.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>The Privy Council was divided in opinion. There was a
desire for the advice of statesmen who were not at the
Board, but who were known to have studied a subject
beset with many difficulties. Among these, Sir Robert
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span> was consulted. He appeared at the Council Table
on the 2nd of September, 1626, and we have a report of
his speech to the Lords, which from several points of view
is notable. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MS. <span class='sc'>Lansd.</span>, ff. 141–152. (B. M.)<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c030'><sup>[13]</sup></a><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Council Registers</i>, James I, vols. v and vi, <i>passim</i>. (C. O.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But a preliminary word or two needs to be
said on what may seem the singularity that a man who, in
1625, was fighting zealously beside the Parliamentary
patriots, should, in 1626, be speaking at the Council
Table as a quasi-councillor of the Crown.</p>

<p class='c029'>It might be sufficient to point attention to the obvious
difference between questions affecting the liberty of the
subject, and questions of mere administration, were this
the only occasion—or were it a fair sample of the only
class of occasions—in which <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> appears as an unofficial
Councillor. But the fact is otherwise. And it is
best to be explained, partly, by the unsettled character of
party connection during the political strife of <span class='sc'>Charles’</span>
reign, as well as long afterwards, and partly by peculiarities
belonging to the man himself.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Life of Sir John Eliot</i>, vol. i, p 468.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
There are not
many statesmen, even of that period, of whom it could
be said as the able biographer of Sir John <span class='sc'>Eliot</span>
says of Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>: ‘He acted warmly with
<span class='sc'>Eliot</span> and with the patriots in the first Parliament of
<span class='sc'>Charles</span>. At the opening of the third, he was tendering
counsel to the King, <i>of which the obsequious forms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>have yet left no impression unfavourable to his uprightness
and honour</i>.’ The result is unusual. How came it to
pass?</p>

<p class='c029'>Perhaps the preceding pages may have already suggested
to the reader’s mind more than one possible and plausible
answer to this question. Here it may suffice to say that
while Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> was plainly at one with the
Parliamentarian leaders in the main points of their civil
policy, he never went to the extreme lengths of the
puritanic faith, either in things secular, or in matters
pertaining to Religion. On some religious questions he
differed from them widely. In secular matters, a tyrannic
Parliament would have been as little to his liking as a
despotic king. Neither friend nor enemy—<span class='sc'>Gondomar</span>
excepted—ever called him a Puritan (or pretended-Puritan)
in his lifetime, any more than they would have called him
a Republican. His ultimate divergence was not cloaked.
It was no bar to the entire respect, or to the love and close
fellowship, of men like <span class='sc'>Eliot</span>, just because it was frankly
avowed, and had no selfish aim. <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>,—had he lived
long enough,—would probably have ranged himself, at last,
with the Cavaliers, rather than with the Roundheads. He
would have had <span class='sc'>Falkland’s</span> misgivings, and <span class='sc'>Falkland’s</span>
sorrow, but I think he would not have lacked <span class='sc'>Falkland’s</span>
self-devotion also.</p>

<p class='c029'>And, in another point, he resembled Lord <span class='sc'>Falkland</span>.
Both would have advised <span class='sc'>Charles</span> to yield much of so-called
‘prerogative.’ Neither of them would have bade
him to yield a grain of true royal honour. In later years,
some words which <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> wrote,—in 1627,—for the
King’s eye may well have come back painfully into
<span class='sc'>Charles’</span> memory:—‘To expiate the passion of the
People,’ said Sir Robert, ‘with sacrifice of any of His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Majesty’s servants, I have ever found to be no less
fatal <i>to the Master</i> than to the Minister, in the
end.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The question of the Coinage, on which he was called
into Council in September 1626, had caused no small
measure of discussion whilst <span class='sc'>James</span> was still on the throne.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Advice given by Sir R. Cotton on Mint Affairs.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Many merchants of London had raised the old and hacknied
cry of complaint against an alleged ‘vast transportation of
gold and silver from England’ to the Continent. Others
said that the complaint, if not groundless, was misdirected.
The following Minute of the Privy Council will shew how
the question stood in that early stage. It was drawn up
in November, 1618.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Council to the King, 30 Nov., 1618; James I, vol. iv, p. 45. (C. O.)</div>

<p class='c029'>‘Being by Your Majesty’s commandment to take into
our consideration the state of the Mint and to advise of the
way or means how to bring bullion more plentifully into
the Kingdom, and to be coined there, as also how to stop
the great exportation of treasure out of the Realm,—a
matter of which the State hath been jealous: For our
better information and Your Majesty’s satisfaction we
thought it fit first to know from the Office of your Mint
what quantity of gold and silver hath been there coined in
the last seven years of the reign of Queen Elizabeth and
the seven years last past of Your Majesty. And we find
that in the said seven years of the Queen there was coined
in gold and silver of all sorts £948,713 sterling, whereas
in the seven late years of Your Majesty’s reign there hath
been coined of all sorts, in gold and silver, £1,603,998.
So as, comparing the one with the other, there hath been
coined of both species in the said seven years of Your
Majesty’s reign £655,285 sterling, more than in the seven
years aforesaid of the Queen, the difference being almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>three parts to one. Next we required a certificate from
the Goldsmiths of London of the Plate that hath been
made in those years within the City of London; and it
appeareth that there was made and stamped in their
hall the last seven years of Queen Elizabeth of silver
plate the worth of £22,187 more than in the seven later
years of Your Majesty’s reign. But upon the whole
matter we cannot find and do humbly certify the same
unto Your Majesty as our opinion that there hath been
of late any such vast transportation of gold and silver
into France and the Low Countries as was supposed;
neither that there is any such notorious diminution
of treasure generally in the Kingdom—at the least
of gold—since it is apparent that there hath been a far
greater quantity in the total coined within these seven
years last past than in the last seven years of the late
Queen. Besides Your Majesty may be pleased to observe
that the making of so much silver plate cannot be the
principal cause of the decay of the Mint since there was
more plate made in London [in] those last seven years of
the Queen,—when there came more silver to be coined in
the Mint,—than there hath been used of late years, when
silver in the Mint hath been so scarce though Gold more
plentiful.... In the mean time we do humbly
offer&#160;... that there is no necessity&#160;...
to raise your coin, either in the one kind or in the other.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Registers of Privy Council</i>, as above, p. 46. (C. O.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But rather that the same may draw with it many inconveniences;
and because the noise thereof through the City of
London and from thence to other parts of the Realm, as
we understand, hath already done hurt and in some
measure interrupted and distracted the course of general
commerce, we think it very requisite&#160;... that
some signification be forthwith made from this Table
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>time to raise your coins.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The course thus recommended—and in the recommendation
the Council seems to have been well nigh
unanimous—was precisely the course <span class='sc'>James</span> did not wish
to take. The Council Books abound with proof how hard
it was to dissuade the King from adopting this ‘intended
project of enhancing the coin [<i>i. e.</i> by debasing the standard],
though, as <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> afterwards said at the Council Table,
to do so would trench, both into the honour, the justice,
and the profit’ [<i>i. e.</i> the real and ultimate profit] ‘of my royal
Master very far.’</p>

<p class='c029'>In his address at the Board, Sir Robert made an almost
exhaustive examination of the history of the English Mint.
He did it with much brevity and pith. His views about
foreign trade are, of course, not free from the fallacies
which were accepted as aphorisms by very nearly every
statesman then living. But his advice on the immediate
question at issue is marked by sound common sense, by
insight and practical wisdom.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MS. <span class='sc'>Lansd.</span>, 811, ff. 148–152 (B. M.) [Compare the Report of Proceedings in the House of Commons, Feby. 1621. (<i>Parl. Hist.</i>, vol. i, c. 1188–1194).]<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
His speech told, and he
followed it up by framing, as Chairman of a Committee,
(1) an <i>Answer to the Propositions delivered by some Officers
of the Mint</i>; and (2) <i>Certain General Rules collected concerning
Money and Bullion out of the late Consultation at
Court</i>. Copies of both exist amongst the Harleian and
Lansdowne MSS., and both, together with the Speech, are
printed in the <i>Posthuma</i> (although not without some of the
Editor’s characteristic inaccuracies).</p>

<p class='c029'>The next question which it was Sir Robert’s task to
discuss before the Privy Council was a much more
momentous question than that of the Coinage. It was,
potentially, both to Sovereign and to people, an issue
of life or death.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>In January, 1628 [N. S.], he delivered, at the Board,
the substance of the remarkable Discourse which has
been more than once printed under the title, ‘<i>The
Danger wherein this Kingdom now Standeth, and the
Remedy</i>.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Discourse on the Calling of a Parliament.</span> 1628. Jany.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The courtliness of its tone no more detracts
from its incisiveness of stroke, than a jewelled hilt would
detract from the cleaving sweep of a Damascus blade, when
wielded by well-knit sinews. It led instantly to the calling
of the Parliament.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MS. <span class='sc'>Lansd.</span>, 254, ff. 258, seqq.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But neither its essential and true loyalty
to the King, nor the opportune service which it rendered
to the country was to make the fortunes of its author any
exception to those which—sooner or later—befell every
councillor of <span class='sc'>Charles the First</span>, who, in substance if not
in form, was wont to put Country before King.</p>

<p class='c029'>In that third Parliament of <span class='sc'>Charles</span> Sir Robert himself
had no seat. In the Parliament which preceded it he sat
for Old Sarum, having lost his seat for Huntingdonshire.
But he continued to be the active ally and the influential
councillor of the leaders of opposition to strained prerogatives.
When the Parliament assailed Bishops <span class='sc'>Neile</span> and
<span class='sc'>Laud</span>, the inculpated prelates, it is said, threw upon <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>
as much of their anger as they well could have done had he
led the assault in person.</p>

<p class='c029'>The opportunity was not very far to seek.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The ‘Proposition to bridle Parliaments.’</span> 1629. October.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Not long
after the dissolution in March, 1629, of that Parliament
of the assembling of which Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> patriotic
effort had been the immediate occasion, and to some of
the effective blows of which he had helped to give vigour,
some courtier or other brought to <span class='sc'>Charles’</span> hands a political
tract, in manuscript, and told him that copies of it were in
the possession of several statesmen. Those—with one
exception—who were then named to the King were men
wont to be held in greater regard in the country than at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Court. The pamphlet bore for its title: ‘<i>The Proposicion
for Your Majesties Service&#160;... to secure your Estate and
to bridle the impertinencie of Parliaments</i>.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The consequences of this small incident were destined
to prove of large moment. The earliest mention
we have of it occurs in a letter written by the
Archbishop of York—himself a Privy Councillor—to
Sir Henry <span class='sc'>Vane</span>, in November, 1629: ‘The Vice-Chancellor,’
says Archbishop <span class='sc'>Harsnet</span>, ‘was sent to Sir
Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> to seal up his library, and to bring himself
before the Lords of the Council.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Domest. Corresp.</i>, Charles I, vol. cli, § 24. (R. H.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In the words that follow
the Archbishop is evidently speaking from what he had
been told, not from his personal knowledge. ‘There was
found,’ he proceeds to say, ‘in his custody a pestilential
tractate which he had fostered as a child, containing a
project how a Prince may make himself an absolute tyrant.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ib.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<i>This pernicious device he had communicated to divers
Lords.</i>’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Charles</span> was presently in intense excitement about
the matter. Its next stage cannot be better or more
briefly told, than in the words which the King himself
addressed to his assembled Councillors—in unusual array,
for they were twenty-one in number—and afterwards caused
to be entered upon the Council Book:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1629. 15 Nov.</div>

<p class='c029'>‘This day His Majestie, sitting in Counsell, was pleased
to imparte to the whole Boarde the cause for which the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>[<i>Council Register</i>, vol. v, p. 495.]<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Erles of <span class='sc'>Clare</span>, <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>, and <span class='sc'>Bedforde</span>, Sir Robert
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, and sundry other persons of inferior qualitie,
had bene lately restrained and examined by a speciall Committee
appointed by him for that purpose, which cause
was this:—</p>

<p class='c029'>‘His Majestie declared that there came to his handes,
by meere accedent, the coppie of a certain “<i>Discourse</i>”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>or “<i>The Proposicion</i>” (which was then, by his commandement,
read at the Boarde), pretended to be written “for His
Majesties service,” and bearing this title—”<i>The Proposicion
for Your Majestie’s Service conteineth twoe partes:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Proceedings against Sir Robert Cotton in the Privy Council.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The one to secure your Estate, and to bridle the impertinencie
of Parlements; the other to encrease Your Majestie’s Revenue
much more then it is</i>.”</p>

<p class='c029'>‘Now the meanes propounded in this Discourse for the
effecting thereof are such as are fitter to be practised in a
Turkish State then amongst Christians, being contrarie to
the justice and mildnesse of His Majestie’s Government,
and the synceritie of his intentions, and therefore cannot
be otherwise taken then for a most scandalous invention,
proceding from a pernitious dessein, both against His
Majestie and the State, which, notwithstanding, the aforesaid
persons had not onely read—and concealed the same
from His Majestie and his Counsell—but also communicated
and divulged it to others.</p>

<p class='c029'>‘Whereupon His Majestie did farther declare that it is
his pleasure that the aforesaid three Erles, and Sir Robert
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, shall answere this their offense in the Court of Star
Chamber, to which ende they had alreadie bene summoned,
and that now they shoulde be discharged and freed
from their restraint and permitted to retourne to their
severall houses, to the ende that they mighte have the
better meanes to prepare themselves for their answere and
defense.</p>

<p class='c029'>‘And, lastly, he commanded that this his pleasure
should be signified by the bearer unto them, who were
then attending without,—having, for that purpose, bene
sent for. His Majestie, having given this Order and
direccion, rose from the Boarde, and when he was gone,
the three Erles were called in severally and the Lorde
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Keeper signified to each of them His Majestie’s pleasure in
that behalfe; shewing them, with all, how gratiously he
had bene pleased to deale with them, both in the maner of
the restraint, which was only during the time of the
examination of the cause (a thing usuall and requisite
specially in cases of that consequence), and in that they
had bene committed to the custodie of eminent and
honorable persons by whom they were treated according
to their qualities; and lykewise in the discharge of them
now from their restraint that they may have the better
convenience and meanes to prepare themselves for the
defense of their cause in that legall coursse by which His
Majestie had thought fit to call them to an account and
tryall.</p>

<p class='c029'>‘The like was also signified by his Lordship to Sir
Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, who was further tolde that although it
was His Majestie’s pleasure that his Studies’ [meaning,
that is, his Library and Museum,] ‘shoulde, as yett,
remaine shut up, yet he might enter into them and take
such writtings wherof he shoulde have use, provided that he
did it in the presence of a Clerke of the Counsell;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Council Register</i>, Chas. I, vol. v, ff. 495, 496 (C. O.).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and
whereas the Clerke attending hath the keyes of two of his
Studies he might put a seconde lock on either of them so
that neither dores might be opened, but by him and the
said Clerke both together.’</p>

<p class='c029'>A reader who now looks back on this singular transaction—and
who has therefore the advantage of looking at it
by the stern-lights of history,—will be likely to believe
that the chief offence of the pamphlet lay (in a certain
sense,) in its truth. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Character and Authorship of the ‘Proposition to bridle Parliaments.’</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It was the much too frank exposition
of a policy which clung very close to <span class='sc'>Charles’</span> heart,
though he could ill afford—in 1629—to have it openly
avowed. The undeniable fact that this ‘<i>Proposition for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Your Majesty’s Service</i>’ was indeed fitter for the latitude
of Constantinople, than for that of London, sounds but
awkwardly on the royal lips, when connected with an
assertion (in the same breath,) of the ‘justice and mildness’
of the King’s own government. The indictment which his
Parliament brought against <span class='sc'>Charles</span>,—and which History
has endorsed,—could hardly be packed into briefer words
than those which the King himself used that day at the
Council Board. His notions of kingly rule, like his father’s,
were in truth much better suited for the government of
Turkey than for the government of England.</p>

<p class='c029'>Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, however, had no more to do with
the authorship of the ‘<i>Proposition</i>’ than had <span class='sc'>Charles</span>
himself. The author was Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Dudley</span>. The time
of its composition was at least fifteen years before the date
of the imprisonment of <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> and his companions in disfavour.
The place of its birth was Florence. It cannot
even be proved that <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> had any personal knowledge of
the fact that the offensive tract had been found in his own
library. He had recently read it, indeed,—in common
with <span class='sc'>Bedford</span>, <span class='sc'>Clare</span>, and Oliver <span class='sc'>Saint-John</span>, and no
doubt, like them, had read it with many surging thoughts,—but
he had read it in a recent transcript, written by a
clerk.</p>

<p class='c029'>Of Robert <span class='sc'>Dudley’s</span> motive in writing his ‘<i>Proposition</i>’
we have also no proof. But the presumptive and
internal evidence is so strong, as to make proof almost
superfluous. The tract bears witness, between the lines,
that it was composed to win the favour—or at least to
arrest the despoiling hand—of King <span class='sc'>James</span>. And there
is hardly a suggestion in it which might not be backed by
some parallel passage in the writings, or the speeches, of
<span class='sc'>James</span> himself, when expatiating on kingly prerogatives in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>some mood of mind a little more foolish than usual, or
when striving—only too successfully—to train up his successor
to follow in his own path. It seems like an irony
of Fate to find that (in all probability,—for here again the
proof is not quite clinching,) the King’s informer, against
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span> and the other offenders, was <span class='sc'>Wentworth</span>, who,
not many years after 1629, was to sum up views of policy
much akin to Robert <span class='sc'>Dudley’s</span> in the memorable word
‘<i>Thorough</i>.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Cotton</span> himself believed that this apparently trivial
incident cost him his life. He said not long before his
death,—‘It has killed me.’ We shall probably never
know whether <span class='sc'>Dudley’s</span> tract had anything to do with
bringing about in the mind of <span class='sc'>Wentworth</span> that eventful
change of political views which is known to have passed
over it (about the time when the incriminated manuscript
was sent so eagerly from hand to hand), and which, in a
few years more, was to work his death also. But one can
hardly avoid, in passing, a momentary thought on the
curious possibility that a pamphlet, written at Florence, in
the hope that it might save, for the writer, some wreck or
remnant of a despoiled inheritance,—may have proved
fatal alike to the close political friend of <span class='sc'>Eliot</span>, and to the
close political friend of <span class='sc'>Laud</span>. A tract of such potency
may well claim a few words about its contents. They bear
in every line the stamp of mental energy, and also the stamp
of moral recklessness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Career of Sir R. Dudley, (the true Author).</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Dudley</span> knew well enough that a rooted dislike
of Parliaments was, in <span class='sc'>James’s</span> mind, combined with
a besetting dread of them. He knew that, between hate
and fear, a Parliament was like a nightmare, for ever
crouching behind the royal pillow. It is the purpose of
his tract to tell the King how to drive the nightmare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>away. He recommends, amongst other and minor measures,
the erection of a strong fortress in all the chief towns of the
Kingdom, to be manned by trained bands, and to be
placed in such situations as shall command the high roads.
In addition to these measures, your Majesty, he says, must
set up a strict system of passports, for travellers. Nor is
all this merely a new and more elaborate version of the old
story of belling the cat. The writer of this counsel knows,
perfectly, that already the King’s poverty is the Parliament’s
power; and that to build fortresses and array
soldiers needs a full purse, not an exhausted one. But he
says,—as <span class='sc'>Wentworth</span> said after him,—that soldiers can
be set to work upon good hopes of the pay to come. A
resolute King, he thinks, with resolute troops at his back,
could do in England what had so often been done in Italy.
He could tithe men’s estates. He could make salt and
some other things of prime necessity a royal monopoly.
He could set a tariff on dignities of honour. He could
establish sumptuary laws, such as should make the vanity
and jealousy of thriving nobodies—men with full pockets
and blank pedigrees—willing contributors to the King’s
Exchequer. He could buy up improvident leases of Crown
lands, and resell them at a large profit.</p>

<p class='c029'>The shortsightedness of such advice as this is now obvious
enough. But advice quite as shortsighted and far less
plausibly couched,—for the eyes that were to read it,—had
been fruitful of result, when offered to Stuarts. Nor
was the man who now offered it to <span class='sc'>Charles</span> a mere clever
talker. He was a man who had already acquitted himself
with conspicuous ability in several spheres of action, lying
widely apart.</p>

<p class='c035'>Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Dudley</span> possessed many splendid accomplishments.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>He had been educated by the same ripe
scholar who afterwards became tutor to Prince <span class='sc'>Henry</span>.
At the age of one and twenty, he had put himself into the
lists with <span class='sc'>Ralegh</span>, as navigator and discoverer, by heading
an expedition to the Oronoco.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The career of Sir Robert Dudley.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In the course of that
expedition he had captured nine Spanish ships; one of
them of twice his own strength. At three and twenty, he
had fought, side by side with <span class='sc'>Ralegh</span>, in the naval battle
in the bay of Cadiz; had handled his ship with an ability
which won the praise of his rivals; and had then fought, in
the land attack, side by side with <span class='sc'>Essex</span>. When his own
unbridled passions and resentments gave a fatal opening
for the equally unbridled cupidity of <span class='sc'>James</span>, and of <span class='sc'>James’s</span>
courtiers, to despoil him of a great estate, and to drive him
into exile, he showed that he knew how to snatch honour
out of defeat. He laid the foundation of a new English
trade with Italy and created—it is not saying too much—the
maritime prosperity of Leghorn. He drained vast
Italian marshes, and made corn to grow where corn had
never grown before. The man who, in early life, had won
fame at once as a navigator full of pluck and resource, and
as an able soldier by sea and land:—and who, on attaining
full manhood, had shown himself both a clever diplomatist
and a great engineer;—did not go to his foreign grave
before he had won literary fame with the pen, and scientific
fame at the furnace of the chemist. He had, in its fullest
measure, the versatility and the energy of his race. English
family biography, I suppose, can scarcely show a
stranger group of lives than the successive lives of the last
four <span class='sc'>Dudleys</span> of that line:—Edmund, the Minister of
<span class='sc'>Henry VII</span>, and author of <i>The Tree of the Commonwealth</i>;
<span class='sc'>Northumberland</span>, the subduer of <span class='sc'>Edward VI</span>, and the
murderer of Jane <span class='sc'>Grey</span>; <span class='sc'>Leicester</span>, the Favourite of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span><span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span>; Sir Robert, the self-made exile, and the maker
of Leghorn. Whilst English history, in its long course, can
scarcely match the fatality which seems to have foredoomed
powers of mind and strength of will, such as are rarely
repeated in four successive generations, to teem with evil
instead of good for England.</p>

<p class='c035'>Such, in few words, was the career of the man, the forgotten
production of whose pen was to shorten the life of a
statesman whose only connection with it—so far as the evidence
goes—lay in the fact that a copy chanced to turn up
in his library; fell under the keen eye of a lawyer who
thought that something might be made of it; and was
then copied—probably by some clerk, who was in the
habit of making transcripts for students to whom money
was less precious than time.<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c030'><sup>[14]</sup></a> In some points of the story
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>there is still considerable uncertainty. But so much as this
seems to be established. How the tract came, at the
first, into Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> library there is no evidence
whatever to shew.</p>

<p class='c035'>It is not the least curious point in this transaction that
the Earl of <span class='sc'>Somerset</span> should have been mixed up with it.
He had been released from the Tower almost eight years
before (namely, on the 28th of January, 1622), but was
prohibited from living near the Court. At first, he was
ordered to restrict himself to one or other of two old mansions
in Oxfordshire—Caversham and Grey’s Court.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Council Registers, James I</i>, vol. v, pp. 230, 425 (C. O.).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Afterwards,
his option was enlarged, by including, in the license,
Aldenham, in Hertfordshire. It is evident that, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span><span class='sc'>Buckingham’s</span> death, he began to hope that a political
career might be still possible for him. And statesmen
like <span class='sc'>Bedford</span> and <span class='sc'>Clare</span>—as well as <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>—kept up
with him a correspondence.</p>

<p class='c029'>More than once or twice, coming events had cast their preliminary
shadows over Sir Robert, in relation to the very
matter which so vexed his heart in the winter of 1629.
‘Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> Library is threatened to be sealed
up’ is a sentence which made its occasional appearance
in news-letters, long before King <span class='sc'>Charles</span> hurried down
to the Council Chamber to vent his indignation on the
handing about of <span class='sc'>Dudley’s</span> ‘<i>Proposition to bridle Parliaments</i>.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Ben Jonson and the Verses to Felton.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>One cause of the rumour lay doubtless in the known
enmity between <span class='sc'>Buckingham</span> and the great antiquary.
This enmity, on one occasion, brought Ben <span class='sc'>Jonson</span> into
peril. Ben was fond of visiting Cotton House. He liked
the master, and he liked the table; and he was wont to meet
at it men with whom he could exchange genial talk. On
one such occasion, just a year before the Florence pamphlet
incident, some verses went round the table at Cotton House,
with the dessert. They began, ‘<i>Enjoy thy bondage</i>,’ and
ended with the words ‘<i>England’s ransom here doth lie</i>.’
Only two months had then passed since <span class='sc'>Buckingham’s</span>
assassination, and these verses were, or were supposed to
be, addressed to <span class='sc'>Felton</span>. We can now imagine more than
one reason why such lines may have been curiously glanced
at, over Sir Robert’s table, without assuming that there
was any triumphing over a fallen enemy; still less any
approval of murder. But there seems to have been
present one guest too many.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Domestic Corresp. Charles I</i>, vol. cxix, § 33.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Some informer told the
story at Whitehall, and <span class='sc'>Jonson</span> found himself accused
of being the author of the obnoxious verses. He cleared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>himself; but not, it seems, without some difficulty and
annoyance.</p>

<p class='c035'>The release from immediate restraint of the prisoner
of November ’29 was no concession to any prompting of
<span class='sc'>Charles’</span> own better nature. Fortunately for Sir Robert
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, his companions in the offence were peers. Their
fellow-peers shewed, quietly but significantly, that continued
restraint would need to be preceded by some open
declaration of its cause. During the course of the proceedings
which followed their release it was asserted—I do
not know by whom—that not only had the ‘<i>Proposition</i>’
been copied, but that an ‘<i>Answer</i>’ to it had been either
written, or drafted. And that the reply, like the original
tract, would be found in Sir Robert’s library.</p>

<p class='c029'>This somewhat inexplicable circumstance in the story is
nowhere mentioned, I think, except in a Minute of the
Privy Council. The Minute runs thus:—</p>

<p class='c029'>‘A Warrant directed to Thomas <span class='sc'>Mewtas</span>, Esq.&#160;... and
Laurence <span class='sc'>Whitaker</span>, Esq. [Clerks of Council] autorising them
to accompanie Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, Knight, to his house and
assist him in searching amongst the papers in his studie or
elsewhere, for certaine notes or draughtes for an answer to a
“<i>Proposicion</i>” pretended to be made “<i>for His Majesties
Service</i>” touching the securing of His Estate, and also to
seeke diligently amongst his papers, and lykewise the
trunkes and chambers of Mr. <span class='sc'>James</span>, and [of] <span class='sc'>Flood</span>,
Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> servant, as well for anie such notes,
as also for coppies of the said “<i>Proposicion</i>,” and for other
wrytings, of that nature, which may import prejudice to
the government and His Majestie’s service.’

The new
search, it seems, had not the desired, or any important,
result.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>A year passed away. The proceedings in the Star
Chamber proved to be almost as fruitless, as had been the
vain, but repeated, searches which wearied the legs and
perplexed the minds of Clerks of Council and of Messengers
of the Secretary’s office.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Domestic Corresp. Chas. I</i>, clxvii, § 65, seqq. (R. H.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But the locks and seals were
still kept on the Cottonian Library. Sir Robert and his
son (afterwards Sir Thomas) petitioned the King over and
over again. But <span class='sc'>Charles</span> had set his face as a flint, and
would not listen. In vain he was told that the Manuscripts
were perishing by neglect; and that, as they occupied some
of the best rooms, the continued locking up made their
owner to be like a prisoner, in his own house. In order
to go into any one of them he had to send to Whitehall, to
request the presence of a Clerk of the Council.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Cotton’s decline of health.—The artful Quack and the wary patient.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Under such circumstances it is not surprising that his
friends noticed with anxiety his changed appearance. His
ruddy countenance became sallow and haggard. It grew,
says his associate <span class='sc'>D’Ewes</span>, to be of ‘a blackish paleness
near to the semblance and hue of a dead visage.’ His
somewhat portly frame stooped and waned. Life had still
some charms for him,—so long at least as he could hope
even faintly, for an opportunity of returning, at last, to
his beloved studies. He was told of the growing repute
of a certain Dr. <span class='sc'>Frodsham</span>, who combined (it seems)
experiments at the retort and still of the chemist, with
the clinical practice of the physician,—when he could get it.
Sir Robert sent for him and desired that he would bring a
certain restorative balsam, or other nostrum, that had
become the talk of the town. The worthy practitioner
preferred to send his answer in writing. With great
frankness, he said to his correspondent: ‘I have now an
extraordinary occasion for money.... Neither
is it my accustomed manner to distil for any body, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>some payment beforehand. So, noble Sir, if pleas you,
send here, <i>by this berer</i>, £17 and 12<i>s.</i>, for so much the
druges will cum tow. I confes that way I worke is deare,
yett must say, upon my life, that I will make’ [you] ‘as
sound and able of body, as at thirty-five,—and’ [this]
‘within five weeks.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MS. Harl., 7002, fol. 318; H. Frodsam to Sir R. Cotton (B. M.).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But the eye for which this naïve
epistle was meant was an eye keen enough to detect the
difference between corn and chaff.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ib.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘I did,’ replied Sir
Robert, ‘expect something of fact, to make me confident;
before I could venture either my trial or my purse....
Promises I have often met and rejected. Error of judgment
must be, to me, of more loss than the money.’</p>

<p class='c029'>By way of addition to the combined anxieties of failing
health, and of a bitter grief, there came now to be heaped
upon <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> shoulders the heavier burden of a conspiracy
to assail his moral character.</p>

<p class='c029'>Large as had been his expenditure on his noble collections,
and openhanded as was his manner of life and of giving,
Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> was still wealthy. Some persons who
had benefited by his repeated generosity thought they saw
an opening, in the summer of 1630, to increase the gain
by a clever and lucrative plot. The method they took
reads, nowadays, less like a real incident in English
literary biography, than like one of those—</p>

obvious risk in a contrivance to extort money by telling such
a tale as that, about a man the fever of whose blood must
needs have abated; even had he not been already broken
down under cumulative weight of the sorrow and hunger
of the heart.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Conspiracy of Wilcox and Stevenson against Sir R. Cotton.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The intended victim, too, was a man with
troops of friends. But the conspirators, it is evident,
thought that Sir Robert’s known disgrace at Court would
tell as a good counterpoise in their favour. A man already
in circumstances of peril would, they thought, be likely to
open his pursestrings rather than incur the burden of a
new accusation.</p>

<p class='c029'>On a June morning in 1630 Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> received
an urgent letter from an elderly woman—one Amphyllis
<span class='sc'>Ferrers</span>—who had the claim upon him of distant kinship,
and upon whom, in that character, he had bestowed many
kindnesses. The letter made a new appeal to his compassion;
told him of the distresses of the writer’s daughter—married
not long before to a needy man—and besought
him to pay them a visit; that he might judge of their
necessities with his own eyes. Both mother and daughter
lived together in Westminster, at no great distance from
Cotton House.</p>

<p class='c029'>Sir Robert paid the invited visit; was told of various
family plans connected with the recent marriage, and,
amongst other things, of a pressing need for some household
furniture. When the talk turned upon furniture, he
was asked to look, himself, at an upstairs room, and form
his own opinion about the request. Both mother and
daughter went up with him; but the three had hardly
entered the room, when a loud battering noise was heard
on the other side of the thin wall which separated them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>from the neighbouring house. And, presently a still
greater noise was heard from the rush of footsteps upon
the stairs.</p>

<p class='c029'>The daughter, it seems, was not in the plot. Her
husband had ostentatiously ridden away from the door on
the previous morning, to go into the country, for an
absence of some days;—exactly like a hero in <span class='sc'>Boccaccio</span>.
At night, he quietly returned, and took up his abode,
by preconcert with his neighbours, next door. In the
morning he lay with those neighbours in ambush. When
they all tumultuously rushed up stairs—into the man’s
own abode—they were full of indignation at Sir Robert’s
wantonness; but,—unfortunately for their story—in their
eager haste they entered the room almost as soon as he
himself had entered it, with his two companions. Nevertheless,
they persisted in their accusation; permitting,
however, when the first burst of virtuous wrath had somewhat
subsided, the appearance of a sufficient indication
that they were not wholly averse from listening to a reasonable
proposal. There was a way, and one way only, in
which that fierce wrath might be appeased. Sir Robert,
however, was indignant in his turn. The purse of the
intended victim remained stubbornly closed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1630. July—Decr.</div>

<p class='c029'>There is no need to pursue the unsavoury narrative. Nor
would so much of the story have here been told, but for the
suggestion which lies within it that the rapid breaking up of
Sir Robert’s vigorous constitution was not perhaps due,
quite exclusively,—as has been commonly believed<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c030'><sup>[15]</sup></a>—to
the malicious privation inflicted upon him by King <span class='sc'>Charles</span>.
For though he was successful in extracting, from the
chief accuser himself, a confession of the falsehood of the
charge, and an acknowledgment that the object of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>conspirators was to extort money, yet the matter brought
him much toil and vexation of spirit. One of the latest
acts of his life was to arrange the proofs of the conspiracy
in due and formal array.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c030'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Cottonian Charters</i>, &amp;c., i, 3, seqq.; MS. <span class='sc'>Addit.</span>, 14049, ff. 21–43. (B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When he had done that, and
had once again made an effort—as fruitless as the efforts
which had been made before—for the recovery of his
library, he seems to have prepared himself for death.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Domestic Corresp.</i>, Charles I, vol. clxvii, § 45, seqq. (R. H.).</div>

<p class='c029'>Sir Robert’s repeated efforts to regain his Library were
not unseconded by friends powerful at Court. But the
King’s stubbornness would not give way—till concession
was too late. The Lord Privy Seal (the newly-appointed
successor of <span class='sc'>Worcester</span>, recently dead), was amongst
those who interceded with <span class='sc'>Charles</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Cotton’s Death.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
A little before Sir
Robert’s death his Lordship sent to him John <span class='sc'>Rowland</span>—one
of his officers—to tell him that, at length, his mediation
had been successful, and the King was reconciled to
him.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Rowland, in Pref. to the Political Satire entitled <i>Gondomar’s Transactions</i>, &amp;c.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span> answered, ‘You come too late. My heart
is broken.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, when he came to lie on the bed of death, had
certain topics of reflection—of a secular sort—on which he
might well look back with some measure of complacency.
As a student of Antiquity he had been conspicuously successful.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Cotton’s Deathbed Reflections.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He had won the respect and reverence of every
man in Europe who had proved himself competent to judge
of such studies. And he had not been a selfish student.
He had made his own researches and collections seed plots
for Posterity. If, as a Statesman, he had missed his immediate
aims more frequently than he had reached them, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>had none the less rendered, on some salient occasions,
brilliant public service. He had shewn, incontestably,
that the true greatness of England lay near his heart.</p>

<p class='c029'>One of his contemporaries presently said of him—when
told of his death—‘If you could look at Sir Robert
<span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> heart “<i>My Library</i>” would be found inscribed
there;—just as Queen <span class='sc'>Mary</span> said “<i>Calais</i>” was printed deeply
on hers.’ But the character impressed on every volume of
that large collection which he so loved is ‘England.’ To
illustrate the history, and to enlighten the policy, of Englishmen
was the object which made <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, from his youth, a
Collector.</p>

<p class='c029'>On the other hand, when the inevitable deathbed reflections
passed from things secular to things sacred,—and
also from Past to Future,—there was very little room for
complacency of any sort. A few years before, when a
better and more famous man than <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> lay in like
circumstances, this thought came into his mind:—‘Godly
men, in time of extreme afflictions, did comfort themselves
with the remembrance of their former life, <i>in which they
had glorified God</i>. It is not so in me. I have no comfort
that way. All things in my former life have been vain,—vain,—vain.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Those words were among Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> own early
recollections. When he was sixteen years of age some of
the dying words of Philip <span class='sc'>Sydney</span> were repeated in almost
every manor-house of England, and at many a cottage
fireside. Those particular words came under his eye, at
the most impressionable period of his life. The document
which has handed them down to us was preserved by his
care.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c030'><sup>[17]</sup></a> Did the exact thought they embody, and the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>words themselves, come into his mind, as they well might,
when he, too, lay upon his deathbed?</p>

<p class='c029'>Be that as it may, such words in Sir Robert’s mouth
would have had a special fitness. And he knew it well.
Happily, he also knew where to look for comfort. He
found it, just as Philip <span class='sc'>Sydney</span>—in common with many
thousands among the nameless Englishmen who had passed
away in the interval between 1586 and 1631—had found
it before him. He could say, as <span class='sc'>Sydney</span> said:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c033'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘My Faith is frail; Hope constant never,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet this my comfort is, for ever,</div>
      <div class='line'>God saves not man for merit.’<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c030'><sup>[18]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>Not long before he died, <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> said to a friend (after a
long conference which he had held with Dr. <span class='sc'>Oldisworth</span>,
a Divine who spent many hours, from day to day, at his
bedside)
such comfort as I would not want, to be
the greatest monarch in the world.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The last Scene.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Bishop <span class='sc'>Williams</span>—who
passed the greater part of the last night in conversation
with him—remarked, as he went his way in the
morning, ‘I came to bring Sir Robert comfort, but I carry
away more than I brought.’ To the last, however, the
ruling passion of <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> nature asserted itself. He could
forgive his persecutors, but he could not shake off the
memory of the bitterness of the persecution. Turning to
Sir Henry <span class='sc'>Spelman</span>, he said: ‘Tell the Lord Privy Seal,
and the rest of the Council, that their so long detaining my
books from me has been the cause of this mortal malady.’
<span class='sc'>Spelman</span> gave his message, and the ‘Lord Privy Seal’ himself
hastened to Sir Robert’s bedside to express his regrets.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>The interview was narrated to <span class='sc'>Charles</span>, and presently the
Earl of <span class='sc'>Dorset</span> was sent, from the King himself. The
new comforter came half an hour too late. The persecuted
man had passed to his rest. He died, trusting in the one,
only, all-sufficient, Saviour of sinful men. His death
occurred on the 6th of May, 1631.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>John Pory to Sir Thomas Puckering; MS. <span class='sc'>Harl.</span>, 7000, fol. 310.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
His body was removed
to Conington, and was interred with more than the usual
demonstrations of respect. The inscription on his monument
is printed at the end of this chapter.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Royal Message to Sir Thomas Cotton</span>, 2nd <span class='sc'>Bart.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>When Lord <span class='sc'>Dorset</span>, on his arrival at Cotton House
with the royal message, found that Sir Robert was already
dead he turned to the heir. If the Earl has been truly
reported, the terms in which he expressed his master’s
condolence and good wishes were ill-chosen: ‘To you, His
Majesty commanded me to say that, as he loved your father,
<i>so</i> he will continue his love to yourself.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Pory to Sir T. Puckering, as above.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The comfort of the
promise could not have been great. Sir Thomas’ experiences
of the rubs of life were, however, to come chiefly from
the King’s opponents; not from the King.</p>

<p class='c029'>His life was a quiet one, up to the time of the outbreak
of Civil War. Until then, its most notable incidents grew
out of the circumstance that it fell to his lot to serve as
Sheriff of Huntingdonshire, during the busy year of
‘Shipmoney.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Sir Thomas <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> was in no danger of being tempted
to follow the example of <span class='sc'>Hampden</span>. The readiness with
which he discharged the troublesome task of collecting the
impost throughout his county probably laid the first foundation
of a strong feeling of personal ill-will towards him, on
the part of the lower class of the adherents of the Parliament,
during subsequent years. He never ranged himself
with the King’s party. Neither would he take any prominent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>part on the side of the Parliament. He had little taste
for public life; and regarded the quarrel with the aloofness
of spirit natural to a man with no dominant political convictions,
and with a decided love for country sports and for
the pleasures of domesticity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Domestic Corresp.</i>, Charles I, vol. cccxliii, § 67; cccxlvi, § 115; cccxlv, § 17; cccxlviii, cccl, § 40; cccliv, § 58; ccclxi, § 104; ccclxvi, § 13; ccclxxi, § 58. (R. H.)</div>

<p class='c029'>He had sat in Parliament (for Marlow) during his
father’s lifetime, and in his father’s company. His correspondence
shows considerable talent. The extensive portion
of that correspondence—in the years 1636 and 1637—which
was imposed on him by the Shipmoney business,
shews also considerable power of dealing with official
details, little as he could have liked them. It exhibits an
anxiety to acquit himself conscientiously of a difficult duty,
and not to shirk any of the incidents of duty merely on
account of their distastefulness. In the ‘Short Parliament’
of 1640 he sat as member for his own county. He does
not seem to have sought for any seat in the memorable
Parliament which followed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Committee of Sequestrations for Huntingdonshire.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>His troubles began in 1644. Much to his disgust he
was appointed to be one of the ‘Committee of Sequestrations’
for Huntingdonshire. The duty was one which any
English gentleman might well have disliked without incurring
the reproach either of idleness or of undue fastidiousness.
Sir Thomas’ repugnance to the work was backed by
a repugnance, not less keen, to those who would fain have
been his fellows in its performance.</p>

<p class='c029'>‘This County of Huntingdon’—so he writes not long
after his own nomination to an ungenial office, which he
refused to accept on the ground of an illness, that was far
from being feigned for the occasion—‘is in an unhappy
condition by Sequestrators. Only four or five men, of
mean reputation and estate, are “Committees;” and they
act (all of them) as Judges, Jury, and Executioners.’ His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>own experience was destined to become a pregnant comment
on that pithy text.</p>

<p class='c029'>His avoidance of all share in the task of punishing, by
fine and imprisonment, those of his old friends and country
neighbours who thought that the duty of loyalty to the
Crown was still a duty, however glaring the faults of the
man who, for the time, wore the Crown, was the primary
offence given by Sir Thomas <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> to the busy patriots
who would fain have had him work with them as a fellow-sequestrator.
His illness (as I have said) was doubtless
real enough; but he also disliked the work, and took no
pains to conceal his dislike. Medical advisers told him
that Bedfordshire—where he also had property—was a
better county than Huntingdonshire for a man who suffered
from chronic ague and low fever. But Sir Thomas needed
no adviser to tell him that, under the existing circumstances
of the country and the times, Eyworth would be a
much more satisfactory abode than Conington for a quiet-loving
man who had other duties than those of a soldier,
who abhorred civil war with all his soul, and who ardently
desired such a solution of the current issues as would
neither make the King a mere dependent on his Parliament,
nor make the Parliament an absolute ruler over the
kingdom. Sir Thomas went into Bedfordshire. Lady
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span> continued to abide at Conington. Very soon after
his departure she received a summons, addressed to her
husband, and couched exactly in these words: ‘You are
assessed eight hundred pounds, according to an Ordinance
of Parliament.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1643. 16 August.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The King and Parliament hath present
use of these monies. Therefore, we pray you, send it up
to us at Huntingdon on Saturday next.’ Before the
receipt of this very summary ‘assessment’ many of Sir
Thomas <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> horses, with a good deal of farm produce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>and other property, had been already seized, by measures
more summary still. Meanwhile Sir Thomas had committed
no act of delinquency; he had simply removed
himself into another county. Payment was refused.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Proceedings of the Huntingdonshire Sequestrators at Conington.</div>

<p class='c029'>The sequel of the story depicts, in small, what was then
passing at large over much of the length and breadth of
England. The farmers on the Conington estate were told,
in the plainest of words, that if they did not pay their rents
‘to us at Huntingdon,’ their moveables would be seized
and themselves treated as ‘delinquents.’ Execution, in
those days, followed hard on process; and little difference
was made, either in word or deed, at the farms and at the
manor-house. On one morning, Lady <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> was visited
in her bedchamber—before she could dress—by five
troopers, who, under her own eyes, broke open her drawers
and trunks, and carried off what they thought meet. On
another, one of Sir Thomas’ confidential servants received a
similar visit; had his papers rifled in a like fashion, and
his apparel stolen. At the stables and out-offices scarcely
any three days passed, during the entire summer of 1643—from
May to August—without some raid or other for
plunder. For much of this there was scarcely the semblance
or the pretext of a legal warrant. During those saturnalia
of ‘liberty’ there was, virtually, no judge in England,
and not a few men did whatsoever seemed good in their
own eyes.</p>

<p class='c035'>Sir Thomas <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> was old enough to remember the
early stages of the long conflict of which—in 1643—this
was seemingly the upshot. In the Parliament at Oxford
he had sat beside his father and his father’s friends. His
correspondence at this time—so far as it appears to have
survived—deals merely with the passing events. It contains,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>I think, no disclosure of any reflections which may
have crossed his mind on the principles which underlay
them. He was probably shrewd enough to see already
that the grossness of the current abuses of popular power
carried with it no scintilla of valid blame upon the first
leaders in that conflict—the real issues of which were still
far off. What he, in common with so many of the best
gentlemen in England, was now smarting under was the
consequence rather of the royal triumphs of <span class='sc'>Charles’</span>
earlier years, than of the royal defeats of his later years.
Had the policy of Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> and of John <span class='sc'>Eliot</span> prevailed
a quarter of a century sooner, there would (very
probably) have been no county committees of sequestrators;
no political scaffolds at Whitehall; no ruling of
England by brute force under artificers suddenly transformed
into generals; no wholesale massacres in Ireland,
fraught with mischief for the whole empire during centuries
to come.</p>

<p class='c035'>Be that however as it may, things were not yet at so
bad a pass, but that a curb could, now and then, be put on
the necks of such busy patriots as those who sat in perpetual
Committee at Huntingdon. Redress was impossible;
seeing that the plunder was dissipated almost
as fast as it was made. But, in Sir Thomas <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span>
case, it was found practicable to put a check on its
progress. He invoked the aid of a powerful friend,
Henry, Earl of Manchester, who represented the authority
of the Parliament in Huntingdonshire. The Earl summoned
the Sequestrators to show cause for their raids on
Conington. He held a court. The new functionaries
were brought—after some ineffectual bluster—to confess
that they knew of no act done by <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> which brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>him within purview of the Parliamentary Ordinance, nor of
any other legal cause to subject him to sequestration. As
the words of confession were on the lips of one active
Committee-man, another functionary blurted out—most
felicitously—‘You are wrong.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Proceedings in the Sequestration of the Estate of Sir T. Cotton</i>; MS. <span class='sc'>Addit.</span>, 5012, ff. 34, seqq.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Master Serjeant Wilde
wished it should be done.’ And, in the sequel, ‘Master
Serjeant’ proved to be strong enough to protract the
inquiry, and even to procure its adjournment to London;
though his attempt to maintain the sequestration—on a plea
the falsehood of which was conclusively proved—came at
last to be entirely foiled.</p>

<p class='c029'>When Sir Thomas <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> came to sum up his losses he
found that they amounted to more than four thousand
pounds (in the money of that day).
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ib.</i>, ff. 71, seqq.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘They have had,’ he
wrote, ‘£1500, in money; besides eleven horses, worth
£140; Billeting at Conington, Eyworth, and other places,
which came to £100; spoil made at Sawtrey and at St.
Germans which £300 will not make good; and besides the
decay of my rents to an amount of at least £600 a-year;&#160;... and now the layers and taxes will take up the
whole of Ladyday’s rent.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ib.</i>, 74.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Meanwhile his unlucky tenants,
in Huntingdonshire alone, had been deprived of a hundred
and ninety horses, and their farms had been stripped both
of provisions and of forage.</p>

<p class='c029'>By way of pleasant diversity to his troubles in Huntingdonshire
and Bedfordshire Sir Thomas received, presently,
a letter from John <span class='sc'>Selden</span>—the old and warmly-attached
friend of his family—warning him that the capabilities of
Cotton House in London had caught the eye of certain
other Committee-men, and had made a deep impression on
them.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Attempt to seize on Cotton House.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
They saw that it would do capitally both as a
lodging house for the entertainment of distinguished
strangers who might come to Westminster, to wait on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Parliament, and as a State prison for very eminent delinquents.
These watchful Committee-men were also members
of the Council of State; and the time had now
come when King <span class='sc'>James’</span> sarcastic and well-remembered
jest—‘Bring me sax chairs, for I see sax kings approaching’—was
turning itself into a very awkward fact. These
Committee-men, too, (like their humbler fellows at Huntingdon,)
had their Serjeant at hand to give them advice
on elastic points of law. ‘Serjeant <span class='sc'>Dendy</span>,’ wrote <span class='sc'>Selden</span>,
‘fairly told me that the Committee and Council were
informed that, by the Patent under which you claim, it
was provided that your interest [in Cotton House] should
cease, <i>during the time of the Parliament</i>.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Selden to Sir T. Cotton; in an Appendix to Cotton MSS. marked ‘16. l.’ fol. 50 (B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Certainly, an
awkward clause to appear in a man’s lease, in days when a
Parliament, beginning its ‘time’ in 1641 had not quite
ended it until 1660. This claim of the Council of State
proved, in the sequel, to have in it no more of real validity
than had that other claim to procure the Conington rents
to be paid ‘to us at Huntingdon’; but, like that, it gave Sir
Thomas <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> a good deal of annoyance before he succeeded
in getting quit of it.</p>

<p class='c029'>It is much to his honour that petty but cumulative misfortunes
like these did not sour Sir Thomas <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span>
temper. When quieter times came, he showed himself the
worthy son of his eminent father, both by the improvement
of his library, at considerable charge, and by the liberality
with which he lent his choicest manuscripts, and, in many
ways, made them and his other collections serviceable to
literature. The still extant acknowledgments of service
of this sort from historians and great scholars are very
numerous.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c030'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>By his first marriage with Margaret <span class='sc'>Howard</span>, daughter
of William Lord <span class='sc'>Howard</span> of Naworth, Sir Thomas had one
son and two daughters. By his second marriage with
Alice <span class='sc'>Constable</span> he had four sons, two of whom died
without issue. Alice was the daughter and sole heir of
Sir John <span class='sc'>Constable</span> of Dromondley in Yorkshire, and the
relict of Edmund <span class='sc'>Anderson</span> of Eyworth and of Stratton
in Bedfordshire, and she brought with her a considerable
dowry.</p>

<p class='c029'>Sir John <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, the eldest son of the first marriage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>sat in Parliament for the borough of Huntingdon in the
reign of <span class='sc'>Charles the Second</span>, and for Huntingdonshire in
that of <span class='sc'>James the Second</span>. But he took no prominent part
in public affairs. Like his father he was twice married. And
his first wife became step-daughter as well as daughter-in-law
to his father, being Dorothy, daughter and heir of Edmund
<span class='sc'>Anderson</span> of Eyworth above mentioned. His second wife
was Elizabeth <span class='sc'>Honywood</span>. He seems to have resembled
his father both in his tastes for a quiet country life, and in
the liberality with which he allowed (on reasonable cause and
to proper persons) access to his library. Nor did Sir John,
any more than Sir Thomas, escape animadversion, when he
allowed himself to form his own judgment of the fitness
or the timeliness of any particular application.

Caustic
Symonds <span class='sc'>D’Ewes</span> writes down Sir Thomas <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> as
‘unworthy to be master of so inestimable a library.’ Caustic
Bishop <span class='sc'>Burnet</span> writes in his turn of Sir John <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>: ‘A
great Prelate had possessed him with such prejudices against
me that&#160;... he desired to be excused’ [from granting
<span class='sc'>Burnet</span> admittance to the Cottonian Library] ‘unless the
Archbishop of Canterbury or a Secretary of State would
recommend me as a person fit to have access.’ Against
strictures such as these, it were easy, but is not needful, to
adduce a score of acknowledgments of deep obligation,

<p class='c029'>The eldest son (also John) of Sir John <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, by his
wife Dorothy, did not live to inherit either the famous
library or the ancestral estates. He died in 1681, and his
later days seem to have been marked by some stormy incidents.
In one point, his troubles resembled those which
disturbed the last year of his great-grandfather’s life;—in
so far as that they were caused by a lady. But whereas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>Sir Robert had the lady thrust upon him, to suit the purposes
of other men, the misfortunes of his great-grandson
appear to have grown out of an ardent but illicit passion—as
ardently, and not less illicitly, returned by its object.
Some scraps of their correspondence which have chanced to
be preserved read, after two centuries of dusty repose,
as if they were still all aflame with that fierce love which an
experienced poet describes as ‘passion’s essence.’<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c030'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c029'>Sir John <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> survived till nearly the close of the
seventeenth century. He was succeeded in the baronetcy
and estates by John, the son of the last-mentioned John
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, who had married Frances, daughter and heir of
Sir George <span class='sc'>Downing</span> of East Hatley in Cambridgeshire.
Sir John, fourth baronet, married Elizabeth <span class='sc'>Herbert</span>, one of
the grand-daughters of Philip, Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery.
Like his ancestors of many generations, this Sir
John <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> sat in Parliament for Huntingdonshire. His
chief claim to honourable memory is that he settled the
Cottonian Library on the British nation for ever, and thus
made its founder, Sir Robert, the virtual and first <span class='sc'>Founder
of the British Museum</span>. This was done by Act of Parliament,
in the year 1700.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>This eminent public benefactor died, in 1731, without
surviving issue. The baronetcy then reverted to Robert
the eldest son of the second marriage of the first Sir John
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, grandson of the Founder. From Sir Robert, fifth
baronet, the dignity came, in 1749, to a fourth ‘John
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span>’ who then became sixth baronet and who was the
last surviving male heir of his honoured line.</p>

<p class='c029'>Sir John had lost his only son—a fifth John—many
years before his accession to the baronetcy, which, on his
own death (27 March, 1752), became extinct. Conington
had long previously passed to a younger son of Sir Thomas
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, second baronet; as shown in the following—</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>The reader who glances at this pedigree will notice that
some of the <span class='sc'>Cottons</span> of 1600–1750 were as fortunate in
getting heiress-wives as had been their foregoers of preceding
centuries. But their possessions were scattered
almost as rapidly as they had been augmented. Conington,
which was the most valued possession of Sir Robert, was
less prized by his descendants. The Council Books show
that some of its appendant manors and members—notably
Glatton and Hulme—gave to the Founder himself a good
deal of trouble. The Sequestration Books show the anxieties
and losses which the busy Parliamentarians of Huntingdonshire
inflicted on his next successor. Other circumstances
tended also to bring the place into disfavour with owners
who had a choice of seats. It lay so close to the great
northern road, as to be exposed to undue demands alike
from the movement of troops and from the tramping of
professional vagrants. Nor was it less exposed, from its
situation, to injuries by great floods.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Desertion of the old Seat of Conington.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Long before the extinction
of the male line, Conington was deserted, in favour
of more attractive abodes in southern counties. We learn
from a passage in Stukeley’s <i>Itinerary</i> that the house was
fast becoming a ruin, even in the reign of <span class='sc'>George the
First</span>; although it had been solidly rebuilt by Sir Robert
himself.</p>

<p class='c029'>‘I thought it,’ writes that antiquary, ‘a piety to turn
half a mile out of the road, to visit Conington the seat
of the noble Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>,—where he and Camden
have often sat in council upon the Antiquities of Britain,
and where he had a choice collection of Roman inscriptions
picked up from all parts of the kingdom. I was concerned
to see a stately old house of hewn stone, large and handsome,
already falling into ruin.’<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c030'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>By the Statute which established the <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> Library
as a national institution, it was enacted as follows: ‘The
Cottonian Library&#160;... shall be kept and preserved, in the
name and family of the <span class='sc'>Cottons</span>, for public use and
advantage.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Establishment Act of 1700.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And therefore, according to the desire of the
said Sir John <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, and at his request, the said Mansion
House,&#160;... and also all the said Library,&#160;... together with
all the Coins, Medals, and other rarities,&#160;... shall be
vested in Trustees&#160;... with a perpetual succession.’ The
first Trustees were the Lord Chancellor <span class='sc'>Somers</span>, Mr.
Speaker <span class='sc'>Harley</span> (afterwards Earl of Oxford), and the Lord
Chief Justice, <i>ex officio</i>; together with Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>,
of Hatley St. George, Cambridgeshire; Philip <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, of
Conington; Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> of Gedding, in Cambridgeshire,
and William <span class='sc'>Hanbury</span>, of the Inner Temple.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>12 &amp; 13 <span class='sc'>Will. III</span>, c. 7.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It
was provided that on the decease of any one of the four
family trustees the heir male, for the time being, of Sir
Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, the founder, should appoint a successor.</p>

<p class='c029'>The furious party-spirit which at this time divided the
country into hostile camps, the leaders of which were at
any moment ready to fly at each other’s throats, was
eminently unfavourable both to the guardianship and to
the growth of the new institution; as it was, indeed, to all
matters of learning or of mental culture. Hardly seven
years had passed before it was found necessary to pass ‘<i>An
Act for the better securing of Her Majesty’s purchase of
Cotton House in Westminster</i>.’</p>

<p class='c029'>This Act recites that since the preceding enactment of
1700 ‘very little had been done in pursuance thereof to
make the said Library useful to the Public, except what
had been lately done at Her Majesty’s charge;’ and that
the place wherein the Library then was, being ‘a narrow
little damp room, was improper for preserving the books
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>and papers.’ The Act then proceeds to declare that an agreement
had been made for the purchase of Cotton House for
£4,500, ‘to the intent that it might be in Her Majesty’s
power to make this most valuable collection useful to her
own subjects, and to all learned strangers.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Within five years, however, this unfortunate Library had
to be removed from Cotton House to Essex House, in the
Strand (1712); and thence again, in 1730, to Ashburnham
House, at Westminster (already containing the Royal
collection), where it had not long been lodged, when the
fire occurred by which it was so seriously injured.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Fire at Ashburnham House.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The
account which the Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry
gave to the Public, shortly after the occurrence of this
calamity, runs thus:</p>

<p class='c029'>‘On Saturday morning, October 23, 1731, a great smoke
was perceived by Dr. <span class='sc'>Bentley</span>, and the rest of the family at
Ashburnham House, which soon after broke out into a
flame. It began from a wooden mantel-tree taking fire
which lay across a stove-chimney that was under the room
where the MSS. of the Royal and Cottonian Libraries were
lodged, and was communicated to that room by the wainscoat
and by pieces of timber, that stood perpendicularly
upon each end of the mantel-tree.’</p>

<p class='c029'>‘They were in hope, at first,’ continues the Committee,
‘to put a stop to the fire by throwing water upon the
pieces of timber and wainscoat,&#160;... and therefore did not
begin to remove the books so soon as they otherwise would
have done. But, the fire prevailing, Mr. <span class='sc'>Casley</span>, the
Deputy Librarian, took care in the first place to remove
the famous Alexandrian MS. and the books under the head
of Augustus’ [twelve of the Cottonian presses, it will be
remembered, were adorned by the heads of the twelve
Cæsars, whence the still existing designations or press-marks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>as for instance, that of the famous <i>Evangeliary of
King Ethelstan</i>, <span class='sc'>Nero</span> D. vi, mentioned on page 132]
‘in the Cottonian Library, as being esteemed the most
valuable amongst the collection. Several entire presses,
with the books in them, were also removed; but&#160;...
several of the backs of the presses being already on fire,
they were obliged to be broke open, and the books, as many
as could be, thrown out of the windows.’ All the MSS.
that were saved, and the remains of what been burnt, were
removed to the Dormitory of Westminster School.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1731 October.</div>

<p class='c029'>At the time of this disastrous fire, the number of MS.
volumes was 958. Of this number 114 were reported to
be ‘lost, burnt, or entirely spoiled; and 98 damaged so as
to be defective.’ Mr. Speaker <span class='sc'>Onslow</span> took immediate
measures, in conjunction with Dr. <span class='sc'>Bentley</span> and Mr. <span class='sc'>Casley</span>,
for the examination of the burnt MSS., and for the repair
of such as were then deemed alone reparable. Three
months afterwards the Record Clerk to whom the task was
more particularly committed, thus reports his progress:
‘One hundred and upwards,’ he says, ‘being volumes of
Letters and State Papers, have been quite taken to pieces,
marked, and bound again.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Report of the Committee appointed to view the Cottonian Library</i> (1732), pp. 11–15; and Casley’s Appendix thereto.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But he laments that ‘there
having no way hitherto been found out to extend vellum
and parchment that has been shrivelled up and contracted
by fire to its former dimensions, part of several of the
vellum MSS. must remain not legible, unless the desideratum
can be supplied.’</p>

<p class='c029'>For nearly a century some of the most precious of the
injured MSS. remained as the fire had left them. But in
1824, by the care of Mr. <span class='sc'>Forshall</span>, the then Keeper of
the MSS. in the British Museum, a commencement was
made towards their restoration, which his successor, Sir F.
<span class='sc'>Madden</span>, zealously and successfully continued. Nearly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>three hundred volumes have been repaired, and more or
less completely restored, (a considerable number of which
were previously regarded as beyond all hope of recovery) to
a state of legibility.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c030'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c035'>The calamity of 1731 brought about what may, in a
sense, be termed a partial compensation, by inducing
Major Arthur <span class='sc'>Edwards</span> to make an important bequest,
with the view of precluding its recurrence.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The bequest of Arthur Edwards.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Owing to the
protraction of a life interest in the legacy—the terms of
which will be cited in describing that eventual Act of
Incorporation which created the British Museum—it did
not become available until other arrangements had made
its application to building purposes needless. It was, consequently,
and in pursuance of the Testator’s contingent instructions,
appropriated to the purchase of books in the manner,
and with results, which will be spoken of in a subsequent
chapter. Major <span class='sc'>Edwards</span> also bequeathed his own collection
of about 2,000 volumes of printed books, by way of
addition to the Cottonian Library of MSS. These, however,
were not actually incorporated with the Museum
collections until the year 1769.</p>

<p class='c035'>For several years, <span class='sc'>Bentley</span> conjoined the Keepership of
the Cottonian with that of the Royal Library. His predecessors
in the office were Dr. Thomas <span class='sc'>Smith</span> (hitherto the only
biographer of the Founder,) and William <span class='sc'>Hanbury</span>, who had
married a descendant of the Founder.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Keepers of the Cottonian Library.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Dr. <span class='sc'>Smith</span> was less
eminent as a scholar—though his learning was great—but
far more estimable as a man, than was his successor in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Keepership, the imperious and covetous Master of Trinity.
For conscience sake, <span class='sc'>Smith</span> had given up both a good
fellowship and a good living, at the Revolution. Literature
profited by the loss of Divinity. He died in May,
1710. <span class='sc'>Hanbury</span>—by a very undesirable plurality—was a
Trustee as well as Keeper. That he was not, in either
capacity, strictly faithful to the spirit of the Trust confided
to him seems to be established by incidents which I find
recorded in the MS. Diary of Humphrey <span class='sc'>Wanley</span>. The
reader will observe that it is possible to reconcile <span class='sc'>Wanley’s</span>
statement with the supposition that the MSS.
alienated had never actually been made part of the
Cottonian Library, though it is as plain as sunlight that
a really faithful trustee would have made them part of
it. As it turned out, the sale of them did no actual and
eventual mischief. On December 2nd, 1724, says <span class='sc'>Wanley</span>,
‘I had a conversation with Mr. <span class='sc'>Hanbury</span>, who owned that
he hath still in his possession many original and valuable
papers given him by his wife’s brother, Sir John <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>,
which now lie in different places. These papers and whatever
else happens to be among them—as books, rolls, &amp;c.—he
hath agreed to put into my hands for my Lord’s
[<span class='sc'>Oxford’s</span>] use.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Wanley’s Diary</i>, MS., ii, 40 (B.M.).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
I have promised that he shall be very
well paid and considered for the same.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Wanley</span> had already recorded a previous visit in which
<span class='sc'>Hanbury</span> had delivered ‘for my Lord <span class='sc'>Oxford’s</span> use, a
small but curious parcel of old letters,’ adding: ‘I believe
he expects a gratuity for them.’ On the last day of
December he received another parcel; and on the 4th
January, 1725, he again writes: ‘Mr. <span class='sc'>Hanbury</span> gave me
another parcel of letters written to Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Without endorsing the violent diatribe of Lord <span class='sc'>Oxford</span>
(the second of the Harleian Earls) against <span class='sc'>Hanbury’s</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>successor—as the almost wilful destroyer of part of the
Cotton MSS.—it must be admitted that there is conclusive
evidence that neglect of duty on Dr. <span class='sc'>Bentley’s</span>
part was a moving agent in the disaster. Under his
nominal keepership the practical duties of Cottonian
Librarian were discharged by an industrious and otherwise
meritorious deputy, David <span class='sc'>Casley</span>.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Project of 1707 for uniting the Cottonian, Royal, and Arundel, Libraries.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>There were many projects for making Sir Robert
<span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> noble collections, both in literature and antiquities,
the foundation of a ‘British Museum,’ before a feasible
and successful project was hit upon.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sloane to Charlett, 7 April, 1707. (Bodleian Library, Oxford).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is curious to note
that one of these schemes embraced, as the groundwork of
the projected national Museum, the collections of Sir
Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, of Prince <span class='sc'>Henry</span>, and of Lord <span class='sc'>Arundel</span>;
and that some particulars of the plan were narrated—to a
country correspondent—by Sir Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, almost fifty
years before his own conditional bequest gave occasion and
means for the eventual union of the collections so spoken
of with the vast gatherings of all kinds, in literature and in
science, to the procuring of which so large a portion of his
own useful and laborious life was to be devoted.</p>

<p class='c029'>When that occasion came, two of the then Cottonian
Trustees framed a Petition to Parliament in which they
expressed their acknowledgments for ‘seasonable and necessary
care’ of the Cotton Library. They alleged that it
had remained ‘almost useless’ to the Public, during many
years, for want of a fixed and convenient building to
receive it; that it had been exposed to many dangers
by frequent removals, and had once run the hazard of
‘a total destruction by fire.’ If, said they, the loss which
the Public then sustained proved to be less than had been
feared, the Public owed the obligation ‘to a great member
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>of this House’ [of Commons] ‘who powerfully interposed
and assisted in its preservation.’ The allusion is to the
Right Hon. Arthur <span class='sc'>Onslow</span>, the then Speaker, who afterwards
became one of the first Trustees of the Museum
established by the Act of 1753.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Petition of Samuel Burroughs and Thos. Hart; MS. in Cottonian ‘Appendix’ (B. M.).</div>

<p class='c029'>The Petitioners proceed to state that their most earnest
wishes are accomplished by seeing a Library, famed
throughout Europe, with the generous gifts of Major
<span class='sc'>Edwards</span> annexed thereto, placed out of all further
dangers from neglect, and that they rejoice to perceive
that the Museum of their own Founder is about to be
enlarged by other rare and valuable collections. ‘We
are,’ say they, ‘fully persuaded that an edifice raised upon
such a stately plan will, by degrees, be stored with benefactions
and become a common Cabinet for preserving
with safety all curiosities and whatsoever is choice or
excellent in its kind. Moreover, being a new institution
for the service of the learned world it will be an honour to
the Nation, an ornament long wanted in this great city,
and a distinguished event in the history of our times.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Heretofore, p. 3.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Then follows the passage which I have prefixed, by way of
motto, to this first division of the volume now in the reader’s
hands.</p>

<p class='c035'>When these Petitioners went on to state to Parliament
that ‘no expression of gratitude can be too great&#160;... for
doing honour to the memory of Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>,’ their
assertion gave rise to no utterance of hostile feeling.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Recent Charges against the character and fame of Sir R. Cotton.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
They
were not even charged with undue laudation of their
ancestor. People who at that time troubled themselves to
think of such matters at all, were agreed in regarding Sir
Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> as unquestionably one of the worthies of
England. Nowadays—as I have had occasion to show
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>already—there are many gainsayers. A distinguished
historian (Mr. <span class='sc'>Gardiner</span>) asperses <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> character
both for statesmanship and for truthfulness; whilst a distinguished
archæologist (Mr. <span class='sc'>Brewer</span>) charges him with
embezzling records.</p>

<p class='c029'>The first charge has been partly met, in these pages, by
the simple apposition and collation of contemporary evidence.
The reader has his choice between the cumulative
testimony of several English peers and statesmen; and the
unsupported testimony of one foreign diplomatist, who
made it his boast to be the enemy of Englishmen, and
whose hostility was graduated in tolerably exact accordance
with the qualities and the deeds which have made
England proud of them. The home witnesses gave their
testimony whilst the events were still fresh in men’s minds.
They gave it in broad daylight, and with open doors.
The foreign witness put his evidence into a secret dispatch,
to be seen by no human eye, out of the Spanish Cabinet,
until our own historian disinterred it, at Simancas, two
centuries and a half after date. Nor is this quite all.</p>

<p class='c029'>If <span class='sc'>Gondomar’s</span> account be true, not only was Sir
Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> life as a statesman a protracted lie, but
his duplicity was so superbly cloaked as to deceive the most
keen-sighted of his contemporaries. The men who sat
habitually at his board in his days of health, and who
ministered at his bedside in all the offices of tender friendship
in his days of sickness and of death, were all wrong
about his character.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>A Discours wether yt be fitt for Inglande to make peace with Spaine.</i> MS. Cott. Vespas. C. xiii, ff. 160, seqq. (B. M.).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And there is this other little fact to
boot: Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> began his public life by as open
a declaration of anti-Spanish policy in relation to the great
question of the Netherlands as ever came from the lips of
our <span class='sc'>Ralegh</span>. He ended his public life with as staunch an
adherence to the principles, both in Church and State,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>which the rulers of Spain abhorred as that which had been
shown by <span class='sc'>Ralegh</span> on the scaffold in Old Palace Yard, or
by <span class='sc'>Eliot</span> in the dungeon of the Tower of London. Meanwhile,
just in the mid-channel of his career, and in the
prime of his faculties, Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> threw himself,
gratuitously, at the feet of <span class='sc'>Gondomar</span>. He humbly asked
leave to take Spanish service in the guise of a political
slave. The historian’s proposition is a bold one. And its
evidence needs to be cogent. English readers now know
quite enough about <span class='sc'>Gondomar</span> to judge whether or not his
sole testimony is sufficient to damn the fame of such a man
as <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>;—to degrade him from the rank of an English
worthy;—to brand him as a criminal virtually convicted of
apostacy in religion, and of treason to his avowed convictions
in politics?<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c030'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>From the nature of things the second charge cannot be
so directly, so compactly, or so effectively met. Almost
a third of the manuscripts which form the most important
section of the Cotton Library consist of, or contain, Papers
of State. Of these a very considerable proportion once
belonged to the State. How came they to pass into the
hands of Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Mr. Brewer’s Account of Sir R. Cotton’s Acquisition of State Papers.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>By Mr. <span class='sc'>Brewer</span> the question has been answered, unhesitatingly
and exhaustively. Large portions of the Diplomatic
Correspondence of <span class='sc'>Henry the Eighth</span> were, he
says, ‘carried off in 1614, if not before, by Sir Robert
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span>.... The original bundles appear to have been
broken up under the keepership of <span class='sc'>Agarde</span>, when the
Treasury of the Exchequer was rifled of its most precious
contents to augment the collections of Sir R. <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>....
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Calendar of the State Papers</i>; Reign of Henry VIII, Pref., pp. viii, ix.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For
the early years of <span class='sc'>Henry</span>, his [Sir Robert’s]
collections are more numerous, and even more interesting,
than the documents in the English, the French, or the
Spanish Archives. They are equally authentic.... By
what fraud or negligence they found their way into the
possession of Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> it is not for me to
inquire.’</p>

<p class='c029'>No writer can be better qualified to speak with authority
on such a topic as this than is Mr. <span class='sc'>Brewer</span>. Familiar
with State Papers and with records of all kinds for a very
long period, he has won the deep respect of all students of
our history by the uses to which his knowledge has been
applied. But the ablest writer will sometimes write
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>hastily. The most impartial inquirer will now and then
reach a conclusion by overleaping part of the evidence.</p>

<p class='c029'>The sweeping passage which I have quoted, like other
passages in Mr. <span class='sc'>Riley’s</span> preface to <i>Liber Custumarum</i>,
previously noticed, leaves altogether out of view three
or four whole classes of testimony—chains not links—having
a vital bearing on the issue. For example—</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sir T. Wilson to King James I, <i>Domestic Corresp.</i>, vol. xcvi, § 41*, seqq. (R. H.)</div>

<p class='c029'>I. It disregards the fact that certain bundles of State
letters and papers were given by the King’s order to
Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, during the reign of <span class='sc'>James the First</span>.
These, indeed, were commanded to be ‘subscriptions and
signatures of Princes and great men, attached to letters
<i>otherwise unimportant</i>.’ But who is to tell us what was
the estimate of ‘importance’ in papers of State formed,
two centuries and a half ago, by <span class='sc'>James</span>, who gave the
order, or by Sir Thomas <span class='sc'>Wilson</span>, who received it?</p>

<p class='c029'>II. It disregards the fact that long before, as well as
long after, that known order of 1618, Sir Robert’s possession
of papers once the property of the Government was so
published and so recognized as to imply, by fair induction,
that the possession must have been—as far as he was concerned—a
lawful one. In his own writings, he iterates
and reiterates reference to national documents then in his
own collection. His references are specific and minute.
Secretaries of State write to him, asking leave to inspect
original Treaties (sometimes in order to lay them before
the King in person) and promising to return them
promptly.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Domestic Corresp.</i>, as above, 1621, March; and <i>passim</i>; also <i>Council Books</i> (C. O.).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Law Officers of the Crown desire him kindly
to afford them opportunities for collating public instruments,
preserved at Cotton House, with public instruments still in
the repositories of the Crown.</p>

<p class='c029'>III. It leaves out of sight the fact that in the correspondence
of Sir Edward <span class='sc'>Coke</span> with Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>there is a passage which also <i>implies</i>—though it does not
expressly assert—that Sir Robert had received from King
<span class='sc'>James</span> a permission to select records, of some kind or
other, from the Tower of London, anterior to the qualified
permission,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sir E. Coke to Sir R. Cotton; MS. Cott. Julius, ciii (Undated; probably 1612). (B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
above mentioned, given in 1618, to select
‘autographs’ from the Paper Office;</p>

<p class='c029'>IV. It disregards that strong implication of a lawful
possession—so far as Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, individually, is
concerned—which necessarily arises out of the fact that at
two several periods the Cottonian Library was under the
sole control and custody of Crown officials;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Registers of Privy Council</i>, 1616; 1629; 1630; <i>passim</i> (C. O.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
that it
remained under such control for an aggregate period of
more than two years; that <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> bitter enemies were
then at the head of affairs; that in 1630 a Royal Commission
was actually issued
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Signs Manual</i>, Charles I, vol. xii, § 15 (R. H.).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘to search what Records or
other Papers of State in the custody of Sir Robert
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span> properly belong to His Majesty, and thereof
to certify;’ and that the existing Cottonian MSS., together
with those burned in 1732, were, one year after the issue
of that Commission, restored by the Crown to Sir Robert
<span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> heirs;</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>e. g.</i> MS. Harl., 7002, ff. 120, 122, &amp;c., MS. Cott. Julius ciii, <i>passim</i> (B. M.).</div>

<p class='c029'>V. It overlooks the circumstance, vital to the issue now
raised, that amongst the MSS. which most indubitably
were once Crown property many can still be minutely
traced from possessor to possessor, prior to their reception
into the Cottonian Library;</p>

<p class='c029'>And VI. It disregards the fact, hardly less important,
that a patriotic statesman conversant both with the arcana
of government at large, and with the special arcana of the
State Paper Office and Secretary’s offices, under King
<span class='sc'>James the First</span> and King <span class='sc'>Charles the First</span>, might have
cogent reasons for believing that some important classes of
State Papers would be likely to remain much more truly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>and enduringly the property of the English nation if stored
up at Cotton House—even had no ‘British Museum’ ever
been created—than if stored up at Whitehall.</p>

<p class='c035'>Inferences and implications such as these are far from
amounting to conclusive proof. But most readers, I think,
will assent to the assertion that, cumulatively, they amount
to a very strong presumption indeed that the stigma
which has been impressed on Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> memory
is both precipitate and unjust. Precipitate it plainly is,
for a confident verdict has virtually been pronounced—upon
a grave issue,—before hearing any evidence for the
accused. Unjust I, for one, cannot but think it, inasmuch
as circumstances which at most are but grounds of mere
suspicion of the greater offence charged, have been so
huddled up with proofs of a minor and (comparatively)
venial offence, that readers giving but ordinary attention
to the allegations and their respective evidence are almost
certain to be misled.</p>

<p class='c029'>For, undoubtedly, Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> stands convicted
of dealing, more than once, with manuscripts which he had
borrowed very much as though they had been manuscripts
which he possessed. Mr. <span class='sc'>Riley’s</span> testimony is, on this
point, conclusive. An independent witness, Dr. Sedgwick
<span class='sc'>Saunders</span>, the able Chairman of the Library Committee of
the Corporation of London, tells me that both the <i>returned</i>
MS. of <i>Liber Custumarum</i>, and also that of <i>Liber Legum
Antiquorum</i>, bear as unmistakable marks of a claim to
ownership on Sir Robert’s part, as those of which the
return was refused.</p>

<p class='c029'>To such proofs as these I can myself add a new instance.
Archbishop <span class='sc'>Laud</span> had procured, from the Principal and
Fellows of St. John’s, the loan to Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>certain ancient Beda MS. of great value. Many years
passed, and the MS. had not returned to St. John’s. The
Fellows cast severe blame on their eminent benefactor.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Archbp. Laud to Sir R. Cotton, MS. Cott. Julius C., iii, f. 232.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>Laud</span> had to petition his friend <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> for the return of
Beda, in terms almost pathetic; and he was so doubtful
whether pathos would suffice that he added bribe to
entreaty. If, he said, ‘anything of worth in like kind
come to my hands, I will freely give it you in recompense.’</p>

<p class='c035'>The reader has seen the abounding proofs of that generous
furtherance of every kind of literary effort which <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>
gave, throughout life, with an ungrudging heart and an
open hand.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Bolton to Camden; MS. Harl., 7002, f. 396.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Sir <span class='sc'>Robert’s</span> openness made his library—to
use the words of an eminent contemporary—the ‘Common
treasury’ of English antiquities. The reader now
sees also the drawback. It remains for him to strike a
true balance; and to strike it with justice, but also with
charity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Book I</span>, Chap. III. <span class='sc'>Life of Henry, Prince of Wales.</span></div>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Henry</span>, Prince of Scotland, and afterwards of Wales,
was born at Stirling Castle on the 19th of February, 1594.
King <span class='sc'>James</span> had married <span class='sc'>Anne</span> of Denmark more than
four years before the Prince’s birth, but a certain grotesqueness
which had marked some of the characteristic
circumstances of the marriage in Norway (in 1589) was
not without its counterpart among the incidents that came
to be attendant on the subsequent event at home. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>of these incidents is thus narrated in the quaint narrative
of a Scottish courtier who made it his business to chronicle
the movements of the Court with newsmanlike fidelity:—‘Because
the chappell royal was ruinous and too little, the
King concluded that the old chappell should be utterly
rased, and a new [one] erected in the same place that
should be more large, long, and glorious, to entertain the
great number of strangers’ who were expected to be present
at the baptism. The interval demanded for the restoration
of this decayed chapel at Stirling entailed an unusual
delay between the child’s birth and his baptism, but it gratified
the King by enabling him to send invitations far and
wide. Had all of them met with acceptance they would
have resulted in the presence of a cloud of witnesses, such
as had rarely been seen in Scotland upon any the most
famous occasion of courtly rejoicing.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Prince Henry’s Baptism at Stirling.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>For the presence of two guests in particular <span class='sc'>James</span> was
anxious. He wished to see an ambassador extraordinary
from the Court of <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span>, and another from that of
<span class='sc'>Henry the Fourth</span>. <span class='sc'>Henry</span> would not gratify his wish,
and the omission was much resented. <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span>, on the
other hand, was ostentatiously swift to comply, but her
willingness was well nigh defeated by one of the common
accidents of life. She had fixed her choice on the brilliant
Earl of <span class='sc'>Cumberland</span>, whose love of magnificence was
scarcely less prominent than was his love of adventure. He
could grace a royal festivity, as conspicuously as he could
lead a band of eager soldiers, or a crew of daring navigators.
Just as the Earl’s costly preparations for his embassy
were completed, he fell sick. Some days were lost in the
hope of his speedy recovery, but the Queen was soon
obliged to nominate the Earl of <span class='sc'>Sussex</span> in his stead.
<span class='sc'>Sussex</span> had then to make preparations in turn. The day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>fixed for the ceremony in Scotland had to be more than
twice postponed, in order to ensure his presence. In all,
more than six months elapsed before the babe was really
baptized. We will hope that the Court Chronicler exaggerates
a little when he tells us that ‘the time intervening
was spent in magnificent banquetting and revelling.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>True Reportarie of the baptisme of the Prince of Scotland</i>, MS. <span class='sc'>Addit.</span>, 5795 (B. M.).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If
so, the potations at Stirling must have vied with those of
Elsinore.</p>

<p class='c029'>When the long-expected day arrived (30 August, 1594)
the child lay ‘on a bed of estate richly decored&#160;... with the
story of <span class='sc'>Hercules</span>.’ The old Countess of <span class='sc'>Mar</span> lifted him
into the arms of <span class='sc'>Lennox</span>, and by him the babe was transferred
to those of the English ambassador who held him
during baptism. Then Patrick <span class='sc'>Galloway</span>, we are told,
learnedly entreated upon a text from the 21st chapter of
Genesis.</p>

<p class='c029'>The Bishop of <span class='sc'>Aberdeen</span> taught, in his turn, upon the
Sacrament of Baptism—first in the vulgar tongue and
then in Latin—and his discourse was followed by the
twenty-first Psalm, ‘sung to the great delectation of the
noble auditory,’ and also by a panegyric upon the Prince,
delivered in Latin verse, from the pulpit. Then came a
banquet, at which ‘six gallant dames’ had the cruel task
assigned them of performing ‘a silent comedy.’ To the
banquet succeeded a ‘desart of sugar,’ drawn in upon a
triumphal chariot. The original programme had provided
that this richly-laden chariot should be drawn by a lion,
for whose due tameness the projector had pledged himself.
But to King <span class='sc'>James</span> a lion, like a sword, was at all times
an unpleasant object. He said that it would affright the
ladies, and that ‘a black-moore’ would be a more safe
propeller. Banquet and dessert together lasted from eight
o’clock in the evening until three of the following morning.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>At intervals, the cannon of Stirling Castle roared, until,
says our chronicler, ‘the earth trembled therewith.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Thus was ushered in a brief but remarkable life. It
lasted less than nineteen years.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 6–17, verso.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Then to the cradle which
had been so richly emblazoned with the labours of <span class='sc'>Hercules</span>,
in all the colours of embroidery, there succeeded
the hearse of black velvet thickly set with its plumes of
sombre feathers. One half, however, of those nineteen
years that stood between cradle and hearse were years
passed upon an arena to which the course of events had
given almost world-wide importance and conspicuousness.
The Prince’s career was, by the necessity of his position
still more than by reason of his youth, a career of promise,
not of performance. But every year which passed
after the removal from Scotland seems to have intensified
the promise in the eyes of those who watched it, as well as
to have deepened a conviction in the minds of nearly all
thoughtful bystanders that to a grand ambition there were
about to be proffered, in <span class='sc'>God’s</span> due time, means and
appliances more than usually large, and a grand field of
action. So it seemed to human expectation. And because,
in those long-past years, it reasonably seemed so, there
is still somewhat of a real human interest attaching to
incidents which, otherwise, would be trivial and barren.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='sc'>Early Dissentions
at
Court.</span></p>

<p class='c029'>One unhappy circumstance which occurred before <span class='sc'>Henry</span>
was eighteen months old testified to the existence, even at
that date, of unhappy domestic relations of the kind which
on many subsequent occasions brought bitterness into his
daily life. Queen <span class='sc'>Anne</span> was deprived of the care of her
child very soon after his baptism. The Earl of <span class='sc'>Mar</span> was
appointed to be his governor, and the Earl’s mother assumed
that place in the upbringing of the royal infant which, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>most cases, custom no less than nature would have assigned
to the Queen herself. Her natural resentment brought
about more than one angry discussion at Court. After
one of those scenes of turbulence, <span class='sc'>James</span> gave to <span class='sc'>Mar</span>, in
writing, this characteristic command: ‘Because in the
surety of my son consisteth my surety, I have concredited
unto you the charge of his keeping.... This I command
you out of my own mouth, <i>being in the company of those I
like</i>. Otherwise, for [<i>i. e.</i> notwithstanding] any charge or
necessity that can come from me, you shall not deliver
him.’</p>

<p class='c029'>In 1599, Adam <span class='sc'>Newton</span> became Prince <span class='sc'>Henry’s</span> tutor;
and the choice seems to have been a happy one. The boy
had a most towardly inclination to learn. The tutor had
both a genuine love of letters and a real delight in teaching.
He had also the wisdom which shuns extremes. Under
<span class='sc'>Newton’s</span> care the child remained, in spite of an obliging
offer from Pope <span class='sc'>Clement the Eighth</span> to have him educated
at Rome under the papal eye.</p>

<p class='c029'>At the death of <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span>, and after receiving the
news of his own proclamation as her successor, the delighted
father wrote to his son—then just entering on his tenth
year—a letter which depicts its writer in a way as lifelike
as does the warrant addressed to <span class='sc'>Mar</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>James’ Letter to Prince Henry on the Accession to the English Crown.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
I quote it,
literally, from the hurriedly-written original, as it now lies
before me: ‘My Sonne, That I see you not before my
pairting, impute it to this greate occasion, quhairin tyme is
so precious. But <i>that</i> I<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c030'><sup>[25]</sup></a> shall, by Goddes grace, shortlie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>be recompenced by your cumming to me shortlie, and continuall
residence with me ever after. Lett not this news
make you proude or insolent. For a Kings sonne and
heire was ye before, and na maire are ye yett. The
augmentation that is heirby lyke to fall unto you is but
in caires and heavie burthens. Be therefore merrie, but
not insolent. Keepe a greatness, but <i>sine fastu</i>. Be
resolute, but not willfull. Keeye your kyndness, but in
honorable sorte. Choose none to be your play fellowis
but thaime that are well-borne. And above all things,
give never good countenance to any but according as ye
shall be informed that thay are in estimation with me.
Looke upon all Englishmen that shall cum to visit you as
among youre loving subjects; not with that ceremonie as
towardis straingers, and yett with such hartines as at this
tyme they deserve.’ And so forth. For, notwithstanding
the King’s haste to set out on his journey, his pen ran on.
But all his advice is in one strain. The variations are for
ornament. In me, he says (only not so briefly), you see a
model king. Mould yourself after that pattern, and you
will be a model prince. ‘I send you my booke,’ he adds—referring
to <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Βασιλικον δωρον</span>—&#160;... ‘ye must level everie
mannis opinions or advices unto you, as ye finde thaime
agree or discorde with the rules thaire sett down.’ Near
as they commonly were in person, in the after years,
<span class='sc'>James</span> still found occasion to write to <span class='sc'>Henry</span> a good many
letters. This one theme runs through them all. But no
amount of hortatory discourse could hinder the new metal
from overrunning the worn and antiquated mould.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Prince Henry in England.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Prince <span class='sc'>Henry</span> came into England in the June of 1603.
He was invested with the Garter on the 2nd of July at
Windsor. Sir Thomas <span class='sc'>Chaloner</span> (son of <span class='sc'>Elizabeth’s</span>
well-known ambassador to the Emperor) succeeded <span class='sc'>Mar</span> in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>the office of Governor. He was a man of many accomplishments,
and had a strong bias for some of the physical
sciences. But it does not seem that he possessed that
force of character which in the elder Sir Thomas <span class='sc'>Chaloner</span>
was a conspicuous quality.</p>

<p class='c029'>From a very early age, <span class='sc'>Henry</span> showed that in him were
combined in happy proportions a strong relish for the
pleasures of literature with a relish not less keen for the
pursuits and employments of an active and out-of-doors life.
He could enjoy books thoroughly, without being absorbed
by them. He had a manly delight in field sports, without
falling under the temptation to become a slave to his
pastime. If in anything his enjoyments tended to excess,
as he grew towards maturity, it was seen in his devotion
to warlike exercises. So that even the excess testified to
that real manliness of spirit which keeps the body in subjection,
instead of pampering its pleasures and its aptitudes.
He seems to have learnt, unusually early in life,
that the natural instincts of youth will have their truest
gratification, and will retain their fullest zest, when made,
by deliberate choice, steps towards a conscious fitness for
the duties of manhood. Alike in what we have from his
own pen, and in the testimonies of those who were the
closest observers of his brief career, we see evidence that
he had formed a due estimate of the responsibilities that,
to human view, lay close before him. Of his thoughts
about kingship we possess only fragments. Of his father’s
thoughts on that subject we enjoy an exhaustive exposition.
The contrast in the thinking is curiously significant.</p>

<p class='c029'>Some of the best known anecdotes of <span class='sc'>Henry’s</span> life
exhibit the interest he felt in naval matters. That tendency
may, perhaps, have taken its birth in a London
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>incident of March, 1604. The Earl of <span class='sc'>Nottingham</span>, Lord
High Admiral, was then in the flush of Court favour.
The Prince had been but for a few months in England,
and his sight-seeing had not, as yet, included the baptism<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c030'><sup>[26]</sup></a>
of a ship.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Origin of Henry’s interest in Naval affairs.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The Admiral prepared that novelty to please
him. It was at the Tower that the Prince first examined
the ‘<i>Disdain</i>’ (15 March, 1604). Whether at the same
time he made his first acquaintance with the most famous
inhabitant of the Tower is matter of mere conjecture.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Life of Pett</i>, MS. <span class='sc'>Harl.</span>, vol. 6279 (B. M.). (Cited by Birch, p. 39.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>Ralegh</span>, at all events, was there<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c030'><sup>[27]</sup></a> on the day when
Phineas <span class='sc'>Pett</span> moored his new vessel off Tower Wharf, for
the Prince’s delight. Before any long time had passed,
<span class='sc'>Ralegh</span> was busy in the composition of a <i>Discourse of a
maritimal voyage, and of the passages and incidents therein</i>,
with a like object. The acquaintance, however began, was
improved with every passing year. Of the many hopes
which came to a sudden end eight years afterwards, few, it
is probable, were more sanguine or more far-reaching than
those of the King’s keenly watched and dreaded prisoner.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Henry and Ralegh.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For England, <span class='sc'>Ralegh</span> saw in Prince <span class='sc'>Henry</span> a wise and
brave king to come. For himself, he saw not only a
generous friend, but a man who might be the means of
giving shape and substance to many patriotic schemes
with which a brain that could not be imprisoned had long
been teeming.</p>

<p class='c029'>There is evidence that on more than one topic of public
policy <span class='sc'>Ralegh’s</span> counsel made a deep impression on
<span class='sc'>Henry</span>. One instance of it will be seen presently. But
apart altogether from such positive results as admit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>testimony, their intercourse is memorable. It must have
been by virtue of some congeniality of nature that a youth
in <span class='sc'>Henry’s</span> position so quickly leapt—across many obstacles—to
an appreciation, alike of the circumstances and of the
character of <span class='sc'>Ralegh</span>, which still commends itself to those
who have looked into them most searchingly. The estimate
has been many times confirmed by the investigations
of history, long afterwards, but it was strongly opposed to
the broad current of contemporary opinion. A heart larger
than the average may have its divinations, as well as the
intellect that is more acute and better furnished than the
average.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Investigation into the Naval Dockyards.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>But the generous heart is often allied with a hasty
temper. The impression made on the Prince by <span class='sc'>Ralegh’s</span>
writings on naval matters had, amongst other results, that
of increasing both his interest in the management of the
royal dockyards, and his familiar intercourse with Phineas
<span class='sc'>Pett</span>. <span class='sc'>Pett</span> was master shipwright at Chatham, and, as
we have seen, the designer of the prince’s first vessel
<i>Disdain</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1608. April. See Chap. ii, pp. 62, 63.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> had induced the
King to issue that Commission of Inquiry into the Navy,
of the results of which some account has been given in the
preceding Chapter, <span class='sc'>Pett</span> was one of the persons whose
official doings were brought into question. <span class='sc'>Henry</span> took a
warm interest in the inquiry and testified openly his
anxiety on <span class='sc'>Pett’s</span> behalf. A specific charge about an
alleged disproportion between timber paid for and the
vessels built therewith was investigated at Woolwich.
Both the King and the Prince were present. <span class='sc'>Henry</span>
stood by <span class='sc'>Pett’s</span> side.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MS. Life of Phineas Pett, in MS. <span class='sc'>Harl.</span> 6279 (B. M.) p. 45.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When the evidence was seen to
disprove the charge, the Prince cried with a loud voice—disregarding
alike the royal presence and the forms of law—‘Where
be now those perjured fellows that dare thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>abuse His Majesty with false informations? Do they not
worthily deserve hanging?’</p>

<p class='c029'>The warmth of <span class='sc'>Henry’s</span> friendship seems to have suffered
little diminution by the absence of its objects.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Henry’s foreign Correspondence.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When
his friends went to far-off countries he encouraged them to
be active correspondents by setting them a good example.
He welcomed all sorts of real and worthy information.
About the government and affairs of foreign countries his
curiosity was insatiable. When important letters came to
him he not only read them with care but made abstracts of
their contents. When the labour-loving Lord Treasurer
<span class='sc'>Salisbury</span> noticed, with regret, in his son <span class='sc'>Cranborne</span>
certain indications of a turn towards indolence, it was by
an appeal to Prince <span class='sc'>Henry’s</span> example that he strove to
correct the failing. <span class='sc'>Henry</span> evinced eagerness to learn by
all methods. Books, letters, conversation, personal insight
into notable things and new inventions,—were alike acceptable
to him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>His Purchase of Lord Lumley’s Library.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>In April, 1609, the death of John, Lord <span class='sc'>Lumley</span>,
without issue, enabled the Prince to gratify his love of
books by purchasing a Library which probably was more
valuable than any other collection then existing in England,
with the exception of that of Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>.</p>

<p class='c029'>Thirty years before, Lord <span class='sc'>Lumley</span> had inherited the
fine library of his father-in-law, Henry <span class='sc'>Fitzalan</span>, Earl of
<span class='sc'>Arundel</span>, who had been a collector of choice manuscripts
at a time when the reckless dispersion of monastic treasures
impoverished the nation, but gave, here and there,
golden opportunities to openhanded private men. When
the estates of the <span class='sc'>Fitzalans</span> came to <span class='sc'>Lumley</span>—in virtue
of an entail made by the Earl of <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> during Lady
<span class='sc'>Lumley’s</span> lifetime—the splendid succession had lost its
best charm. The wife who had thus enriched him was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>dead, and he was childless. His wife’s sister, the Duchess
of <span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>, was also dead, but had left a son.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Muniments at Norf. House (Sussex, Box 7), as cited in Tierney’s <i>Arundel</i>, p. 19.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>Lumley</span>
sold his life interest in the broad lands, and forests, and in
the famous castle of Arundel, to the next heir, but he kept
the library and found one of the chief pleasures of his
remaining term of life in liberally augmenting it. <span class='sc'>Henry’s</span>
first care, after his purchase, was to have a careful catalogue
made of the collection. And he soon gave evidence
that he had bought the books for use; not for show.

(R. H.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He
also made many important additions, from time to time,
during his three years’ ownership.</p>

<p class='c029'>Perhaps the most festive days of that brief span were the
sixth of January, 1610, and the sixth of June of the same
year, on both of which Whitehall again witnessed a gay
tournament.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Tournaments of 1610.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
On twelfth-day, at the head of a band of
knights which included <span class='sc'>Lennox</span>, <span class='sc'>Arundel</span>, <span class='sc'>Southampton</span>,
<span class='sc'>Hay</span>, Sir Thomas <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>, and Sir Richard <span class='sc'>Preston</span>,
<span class='sc'>Henry</span> kept his barriers against fifty-six assailants, and
before a brilliant court, for whose pleasure the long mimic
fight was diversified by the gay devices of Inigo <span class='sc'>Jones</span>, and
the graceful verses of Ben <span class='sc'>Jonson</span>. Next day the jousting
was followed by a banquet not less splendid.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Chronicle of England</i>, p. 898. <i>The Speeches at Prince Henries Barriers</i>; and <i>Oberon, a Masque</i>. (Jonson’s <i>Works</i>, vol. v, pp. 965–974, 1st edit.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
At Whitehall,—as
at Stirling sixteen years before,—the banquetting
lasted seven hours, but it was enlivened by a comedy in
which the ladies were not condemned to silence. In the
following June, <span class='sc'>Henry’s</span> creation as Prince of <span class='sc'>Wales</span> was
celebrated by tiltings on a more extensive scale, as well as
by masques and dances, and by an elaborate naval battle
upon the Thames. But the prince himself seems to have
taken more pleasure in witnessing from time to time, at
Woolwich or at Chatham, the launching of real ships
fitted for real warfare. Nor are indications wanting that
during his ponderings on the many advices which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>received of the course of public events in Europe, he had
occasional presentiments that a crisis was drawing near
which would make the adoption of a warlike policy to
be alike the duty of the King, and the recognized interest
of the nation.</p>

<p class='c029'>Be that as it may, the broad contrasts of character which
existed between the wearer of the crown and its heir apparent
became increasingly obvious during the long negotiations
and correspondence about the projects of marriage
for the prince himself and for his sister.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The projects for Royal Marriages.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1611–1612.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Something,
indeed, of the difference in character between <span class='sc'>James</span> and
<span class='sc'>Henry</span> was indicated when, in 1611, the prince directed
<span class='sc'>Ralegh</span> to draw up, in his prison, a paper of advice on the
scheme of a double marriage with Savoy and on the relations
between Savoy and Spain. It came out more forcibly
when, on occasion of the proposal from France for his own
marriage with <span class='sc'>Christina</span> (the elder sister of <span class='sc'>Henrietta
Maria</span>), he wrote to his father in these words: ‘The cause
which first induced your Majesty to proceed in this proposition
by your Ambassador was the hope which the Duke
of <span class='sc'>Bouillon</span> gave your Majesty of breaking their other
match with Spain. If the continuance of this treaty hold
only upon that hope, and not upon any desire to effect a
match with the second daughter, in my weak opinion I hold
that it stands more with your Majesty’s honour to stay
your Ambassador from moving it any more than to go on
with it. Because no great negotiation should be grounded
upon a ground that is very unsure and uncertain, and
depends upon their wills who were the first causers of the
contrary.’ For this letter the Prince was rebuked. Two
months afterwards, it was found indispensable to desire
him to express again his opinion upon a new stage of the
negotiation. He did so in words to which the events of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>the next few years were destined to give significance. I
quote from the original letter, preserved (with a large mass
of other letters from the same hand) amongst the Harleian
MSS.<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c030'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c029'>‘As for the exercise of the princess’ religion,’ wrote <span class='sc'>Henry</span>,
on the 5th of October, 1612, ‘your Majesty may be pleased
to make your Ambassador give a peremptory answer that
you will never agree to give her greater liberty in the exercise
of it than that which is agreed with the Savoyeard, which
is—to use his own word—<i>privatemente</i>; or, as Sir Henry
<span class='sc'>Wotton</span> did expound it, “in her most private and secret
chamber.”’ Then he touches on the delicate question of
dowry, and the relative preferability of the alliance proffered
by France and that proffered by Savoy; adding,—with an
obvious mental reference, I think, to the advice given him
by <span class='sc'>Ralegh</span> in the preceding year,—these pregnant words:
‘If your Majesty will respect rather which of these two will
give the greatest contentment to the general body of the
Protestants abroad, then I am of opinion that you will
sooner incline to France than to Savoy.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1612. Oct. 5. Henry to James; MS. <span class='sc'>Harl.</span>, 6986, f. 180.</div>

<p class='c029'>The writer then hints a fear that he may, unwittingly,
have incurred a renewal of the paternal displeasure which
some expressions of opinion in his former letter on the same
subject had excited. Let his father kindly remember, he
entreats, that his own special part in the business,—‘which
is to be in love with any of them, is not yet at
hand.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Death, not love-making, was at hand. One month afterwards,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the arm that penned this letter was stretched out,—still
and rigid.</p>

<p class='c029'>The Prince was seized with sudden illness on the 10th of
October, five days after its date.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Death.</span> 1612. November.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The first appearances
were such as are wont to follow upon a great chill, after
excessive exercise—to which <span class='sc'>Henry</span> was always prone. In
spite of much pain and some alarming symptoms, he persisted
in removing from Richmond to St. James’ on the
16th, in order to receive the Elector Palatine, soon to
become the husband of his sister. Within very few days
it was apparent that his illness was of the most serious
nature. He left his apartment at St. James’ on the morning
of the 25th, to hear a sermon at the Chapel Royal. The
text was from the fourteenth of Job, ‘<i>Man, that is born
of a woman, is of short continuance</i>.’ Afterwards he dined
with the King, but was obliged to take his leave, being
seized with faintness and shivering fits. These continued to
recur, at brief intervals, until his death, on the evening of
the sixth of November. Almost the only snatch of quiet
sleep which he could obtain followed upon the administration
of a cordial, prepared for him in the Tower by
<span class='sc'>Ralegh</span>, at the Queen’s earnest request. It was not given
until the morning of the last day.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Henry</span> died calmly, but under total exhaustion. For
many hours before his death he was unconscious, as
well as speechless. The last words to which he responded
were those of Archbishop <span class='sc'>Abbot</span>:—‘In sign of
your faith and hope in the blessed Resurrection, give us,
for our comfort, a sign by the lifting up of your hands.’
<span class='sc'>Henry</span> raised both hands, clasped together. It was his
last conscious act.</p>

<p class='c035'>Here, to human ken, was a life all seed-time. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>harvest belonged to the things unseen. Contemporaries
who had treasured up, in memory, many of those small
matters which serve to mark character, were wont sometimes
to draw contrasts between the prince and his brother.
And many have been the speculations—natural though
unfruitful—as to the altered course of English history, had
<span class='sc'>Henry</span> lived to ascend the throne. One fact, observable in
the correspondence and documentary history of the times,
will always retain a certain interest. Some of those who
were to rank among the staunchest opponents of <span class='sc'>Charles</span>
were men who thought highly of <span class='sc'>Henry’s</span> abilities to rule,
and who held his memory in affectionate reverence.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Disposal of the Prince’s Library.</span></div>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Henry</span> had died intestate. The library which he had
purchased from the Executors of Lord <span class='sc'>Lumley</span> fell to the
disposal of the King. The greater part of it went to augment
the remains of the old royal library of England,
portions of which had been scattered during <span class='sc'>James’</span> reign,
as well as before it. By that disposal of a collection, in
which the prince had taken not a little delight during his
brief possession, he became virtually, and in the event, a
co-founder of the British Museum.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Union of the St. James’ and Whitehall Libraries.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The library remained at St. James’ under the charge, for
a time, of the prince’s librarian, Edward <span class='sc'>Wright</span>. The
relics of the royal collection at Whitehall were then in the
keeping of the eminent scholar and theologian, Patrick
<span class='sc'>Young</span>. Eventually they too were brought to St. James’,
and <span class='sc'>Young</span> took the entire charge. It was by his exertions
that the combined collection was augmented by a valuable
part of the library of Isaac <span class='sc'>Casaubon</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Roe, <i>Negotiations</i>, pp. 335; 618.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It was to his hands
that Sir Thomas <span class='sc'>Roe</span> delivered the ‘Alexandrian Manuscript’
of the Greek Bible, the precious gift to King <span class='sc'>Charles</span>
of Cyril <span class='sc'>Lucar</span>, Patriarch of Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Young</span> survived until 1652, but he was deprived of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>office in 1648. In that turbulent time the library narrowly
escaped two perils. Some of the soldiers of the triumphant
party sought to disperse it, piecemeal, for their individual
profit. Some of the leaders of that party formed a scheme
to export it to the Continent for a like purpose. It stands
to the credit of a somewhat fanatical partisan—Hugh
<span class='sc'>Peters</span>, one of the many men who are doomed to play in
history the part of scapegoats, whatever their own sins may
have really been—that his hasty assumption of librarianship
(1648) saved the library from the first danger.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Comp. <i>Order-Book of Council of State</i>, vol. v, p. 454, and vol. xxiv, p. 604. (R. H.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
A like act
on the part of Bulstrode <span class='sc'>Whitelocke</span>, in the following year
(July, 1649), saved it from the second. Probably, it was at
his instance that the Council of State made or designed to
make it a Public Library.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Whitelocke’s</span> <i>Embassy to Sweden</i>, vol. i, p. 273. (Reeve’s edit.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Four years afterwards, <span class='sc'>Whitelocke</span>
held at Stockholm a curious conversation with Queen Christina
about its manuscript treasures, of some of which, he
tells us, she was anxious to possess transcripts.</p>

<p class='c029'>Under the Commonwealth, the librarianship had been
combined, first with the keepership of the Great Seal, and
then with an Embassy to Sweden. Under the Restoration,
it was held in plurality with an active commission in the
Royal Navy.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Acquisition of the Theyer Library.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>Charles II</span>, however, caused some valuable
additions to be made to the library. Of these the most
important was the manuscript collection which had belonged,
successively, to John and Charles <span class='sc'>Theyer</span>. The sum given
was £560. The collection came to St. James’ Palace in
1678. It was rich in historical manuscripts and in the
curiosities of mediæval science. It embraced many of the
treasured book-possessions of a long line of Abbots and Priors
of Llanthony,<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c030'><sup>[29]</sup></a> and the common-place-books of Archbishop
<span class='sc'>Cranmer</span>.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>At <span class='sc'>Charles the Second’s</span> death the number of works in
the royal collection had increased to more than ten thousand.
No doubt, in that reign, the books could have brought
against their owner the pithy complaint to which <span class='sc'>Petrarch</span>
gave expression, on behalf of some of their fellows, at an
earlier day: ‘Thou hast many books tied in chains which,
if they could break away and speak, would bring <i>thee</i> to
the judgment of a private prison....
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Petrarch, <i>De remediis utriusque fortunæ</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
They would weep
to think that one man—ostentatious of a possession for
which he hath no use—should own a host of those precious
things that many a passionate student doth wholly lack.’</p>

<p class='c029'>No true lover of books, for their own sake, indeed, was
ever to possess that rich collection, until it passed into the
ownership of the nation. Its entail, so to speak, as a
heirloom of the Crown, was cut off, just as it was about to
pass into the hands of the one English King who alone,
of all the Monarchs since <span class='sc'>Charles the First</span>, cared about
books. That it should pass to the Nation had been proposed
by Richard <span class='sc'>Bentley</span>, when himself royal librarian,
sixty years before the proposal became a fact. ‘’Tis easy
to foresee,’ said <span class='sc'>Bentley</span>, ‘how much the glory of our
Nation will be advanced by erecting a Free Library of all
sorts of books.’ In his day, he saw no way to such an
establishment, otherwise than by transfer of the royal
collection.</p>

<p class='c029'>There is a reasonable, perhaps it might be said a strong,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>probability that when <span class='sc'>Bentley</span> gave expression to this
wish, at the close of the seventeenth century, he was
unconsciously reviving one among many projects for the
public good which had been temporarily buried in the
grave of Prince <span class='sc'>Henry</span>. For under the Commonwealth,
the Library at St. James’ had been ‘Public’ rather in
name than in fact.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The ultimate incorporation of the Royal Library with the Collections of Sloane and of Cotton.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>When the time came, the number of volumes of the
Royal Collection which remained to be incorporated with
the Museum of <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> and with the Library of Sir Robert
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span> was somewhat more than twelve thousand. The
number of separate works—printed and manuscript together—probably
exceeded fifteen thousand.</p>

<p class='c029'>Amongst the acquisitions so gained by the nation the
first place of honour belongs to the <i>Codex Alexandrinus</i>.
It stands, by the common consent of biblical palæographers,
in a class of manuscripts of the Holy Scriptures into
which only two or three other codices in the world can
claim to be admitted. Of early English chronicles there is
a long series which to their intrinsic interest as primary
materials of our history add the ancillary interest of having
been transcribed—sometimes of having been composed—expressly
for presentation to the reigning Monarch. Here
also, among a host of other literary curiosities, is the group
of romances which John <span class='sc'>Talbot</span>, Earl of Shrewsbury,
caused to be compiled for <span class='sc'>Margaret</span> of Anjou; and the
autograph <i>Basilicon</i>, written for Prince <span class='sc'>Henry</span>. Among
the innumerable printed treasures are choice books which
accrued as presentation copies to the sovereigns of the
House of <span class='sc'>Tudor</span>, beginning with a superb series of illuminated
books on vellum, from the press of Anthony
<span class='sc'>Verard</span> of Paris, given to <span class='sc'>Henry the Seventh</span>. For
large as had been the losses sustained by the original
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>royal library, and truly as it may be said that Prince
<span class='sc'>Henry’s</span> acquisitions amounted virtually to its re-foundation,
many of the finest books of long anterior date had
survived their varied perils. And some others have
rejoined, from time to time, their old companions, after
long absence.</p>

<p class='c029'>The royal collection has also an adventitious interest—in
addition to the main one—from another point of
view. It includes results of the strong-handed confiscations
of our kings, as well as of the purchases they made,
and the gifts they received. Both the royal manuscripts
and the royal printed books contain many memorials of
careers in which our poets no less than our historians have
found, and are likely to find, an undying charm.</p>

<p class='c029'>The Collector of the Arundel Marbles and Founder
of the Arundel Library was the great-grandson of that
twenty-first Earl of <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> (Henry <span class='sc'>Fitzalan</span>) by
whom had been collected the choicest portion of the
library which passed, in 1609, from the possession of
John, Lord <span class='sc'>Lumley</span>, to that of <span class='sc'>Henry</span>, Prince of Wales.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>chap. iii, p. 162<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>That Earl had profited by the opportunities which the
dissolution of the monasteries presented so abundantly to
collectors at home. The new Earl profited, in his turn, by
larger and far more varied opportunities, offered to him
during a long course of travel abroad. For himself, his
travels ripened and expanded a somewhat crude and irregular
education. He attained, at length, and in a much
greater degree (as it seems) than any of his contemporaries,
to that liberal culture which enabled him to appreciate, and
to teach his countrymen to appreciate, the arts from which
Greece and Italy had derived so much of their glory;
whilst in England those arts had, as yet, done very little
either to enhance the enjoyments and consolations of human
life, or to call into action powers and aptitudes which had
long lain dormant. It is not claiming too much for the
Earl of <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> to say that of whatever, upon a fair
estimate, England may be thought to owe to its successful
cultivation of the Arts of Design, he was the first conspicuous
promoter. Nor is his rank as a pioneer in the
encouragement of the systematic study of archæology—a
study so fruitful of far-reaching result—less eminent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Foreign Travel, under Tudors and Stuarts.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>He may also be regarded as setting, by the course he
took with his own children, the fashion of foreign travel,
as a necessary complement of the education of men of rank
and social position. The example became very influential,
and in a sphere far broader than the artistic one. Under
<span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span>, the Englishmen best known on the Continent
had been political exiles. Most of them were men self-banished.
Many of them passed their lives in defaming
and plotting against the country they had left. The jealous
restrictions upon the liberty of travel imposed by the Government
rarely kept at home the men of mischief, but
were probably much more successful in confining men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>whose free movements would have been fruitful in good
alike to the countries they visited and to their own. The
altered circumstances which ensued upon the accession of
<span class='sc'>James</span> notoriously gave facilities to wider Continental intercourse;
and it was by men who followed very much in
Lord <span class='sc'>Arundel’s</span> track that some of the best social results
of that intercourse were won.</p>

<p class='c035'>Thomas <span class='sc'>Howard</span>, Earl of Arundel, Surrey, and Norfolk,
was twentieth in lineal descent from that William de
<span class='sc'>Albini</span> who, in the year 1139, had acquired the Castle
and Earldom of Arundel by virtue of his marriage with the
widow of King <span class='sc'>Henry the First</span>. He was born at
Finchingfield, in Essex, in 1585,—a date which nearly
marks the period of lowest depression in the strangely
varied fortunes of an illustrious family.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Thomas, D. of Norfolk to his son Philip, &amp;c., MS. Harl., 787.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Philip, Earl of
<span class='sc'>Arundel</span>, the father of Earl Thomas, was already in the
Tower, and was experiencing, in great bitterness, the truth
of words written to him by his own father, when in like
circumstances:—‘Look into all Chronicles, and you shall
find that, in the end, high degree brings heaps of cares,
toils in the State, and most commonly (in the end) utter
overthrow.’ Before Thomas <span class='sc'>Howard</span> had reached his fifth
year his mother—co-heiress of the ‘<span class='sc'>Dacres</span> of the North’—had
to write to the Lord Treasury <span class='sc'>Burghley</span>: ‘Extremytye
inforceth me to crave succour,’ and to illustrate
her assertion by a detail of miseries.</p>

<p class='c029'>The hopes with which the <span class='sc'>Stuart</span> accession was naturally
anticipated by all the <span class='sc'>Howards</span>, were by some of
them more than realized, but the heir of Arundel was not
of that number. He was, indeed, restored in blood to
such honours as his father, Earl Philip, had enjoyed, and
also to the baronies forfeited by his grandfather, Thomas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Duke of <span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>, in 1572. But the dignities were
restored without the lands. His nearest relations profited
by their influence at Court to obtain grants of his chief
ancestral estates. The Earls of <span class='sc'>Nottingham</span>, <span class='sc'>Northampton</span>,<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c030'><sup>[30]</sup></a>
and <span class='sc'>Suffolk</span> had each of them a share in the
spoil;—salving their consciences, probably, by the reflection
that, despite his poverty, their young kinsman had made a
great marriage. For his alliance, in 1606, with Lady
Aletheia <span class='sc'>Talbot</span>, daughter and co-heir of Gilbert, Earl of
<span class='sc'>Shrewsbury</span>, had already brought to him considerable
means in hand, and a vast estate in prospect. The marriage,
in higher respects, was also a happy one. But a
natural and eager desire to recover what his father had forfeited
cast much anxiety over years otherwise felicitous.
He could not regain even Arundel House in London, until
he had paid £4000 for it to the Earl of <span class='sc'>Nottingham</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Arundel at Court.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Lord <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> made his first appearance at Court in
1605. In May, 1611, he was created a Knight of the
Garter. Thirteen years of <span class='sc'>James’</span> reign had passed before
the Earl was admitted to the Privy Council. This honour
was conferred upon him in July, 1616. Five years more
were to pass before his restoration to his hereditary office
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>of Earl Marshal of England, although he had been made
one of six Commissioners for the discharge of its duties in
October, 1616. The baton was at length (29th August,
1621) delivered to him at <span class='sc'>Theobalds</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Domestic Corresp.</i>, James I, 1621, 21 July. (R. H.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘The King,’ wrote
John <span class='sc'>Chamberlain</span> to Sir Dudley <span class='sc'>Carleton</span>, when communicating
the news, ‘would have given him £2000 a year
pension withal, but—whatsoever the reason was—he would
accept but the ordinary fee, which is twenty pounds per
annum.’ It is plain, however, that this assertion was an
error. According to the ancient constitution of the Earl
Marshal’s office there were certain fees accruing from it
which were now, under new regulations, to cease. The
question arose, Shall the Earl Marshal be compensated by
pension, or (according to a pernicious fashion of the age)
by the grant, or lease, of a customs duty upon some
largely vended commodity?
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Minutes of Correspondence in Sec. Conway’s Letter Book; (R. H.) and Council Books (C. O.).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The ‘impost of currants’ was
eventually fixed upon. But the Earl had subsequent occasion
to adduce evidence before a Committee of the Privy
Council, that the rent paid to the King sometimes exceeded
the aggregate duty collected from the merchants.<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c030'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c029'>There is some uncertainty as to the date of the earliest
of Lord <span class='sc'>Arundel’s</span> many visits to the Continent. According
to Sir Edward <span class='sc'>Walker</span>, he was in Italy in 1609. But
that statement is open to doubt. There is proof that in
1612 he passed some time in Florence and in Siena. With
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>Siena, as a place of residence, he was especially delighted.
Of the foundation of his collections—to which his Italian
journeys largely contributed—there are no distinct records
until the following year.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Arundel to Rochester, MS. Cott. Titus, B. vii, f. 463.</div>

<p class='c029'>The tour of 1613, followed immediately upon the marriage
of the Princess <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span> with <span class='sc'>Frederick</span>, Count
Palatine of the Rhine. The royal pair were escorted into
Germany by both Lord and Lady <span class='sc'>Arundel</span>, who soon left
the Rhine country on a new visit to Italy, and remained
there until nearly the close of 1614.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Beginnings of the Arundelian Collections.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
During that long
residence the Earl established a wide intercourse with the
most distinguished artists and archæologists of Italy, and
made extensive purchases. The fame of his princely tastes
was spread abroad. It soon became notorious that by this
open-handed collector marbles, vases, coins, gems, manuscripts,
pictures, were received with equal welcome. And
from this time onwards many passages occur in his correspondence
which indicate the keen and minute interest
he took in the researches of the agents who, in various parts
of the Continent, were busy on his behalf. The pursuit
did not lack the special zest of home rivalry, as will
be seen hereafter.</p>

<p class='c035'>Not the least singular incident in the early part of Lord
<span class='sc'>Arundel’s</span> life was his commitment to the Tower, at
a moment when his favour with King <span class='sc'>James</span> was at its
height.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1621, May.</div>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The quarrel between Lords Arundel and Spencer.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>In one of the many impassioned parliamentary debates
which occurred during the session of 1621 an allusion was
made by Lord <span class='sc'>Spencer</span> to the unhappy fate of two famous
ancestors of the Earl of <span class='sc'>Arundel</span>, and it was made in a
way which induced the Earl to utter an unwise and unjust
retort. The matter immediately under discussion was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>very small one, but it had grown out of the exciting question
of monopolies, and it was mixed up with the yet more
exciting question of the overweening powers entrusted by
the King to <span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>. In the course of an examination
at the bar of the House of Lords about the grant
of a patent for licensing inns, Sir Henry <span class='sc'>Yelverton</span> had
made a furious attack upon the Duke. The attack was
still more an insult to the House, than to the King’s
favourite, and it had been repeated. It was proposed, on
a subsequent day, to call <span class='sc'>Yelverton</span> to the bar for the third
time, in order to see if he would then offer the apology
which before he had refused. <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> opposed the
motion. ‘We have his words; we need hear no more,’ he
said. Lord <span class='sc'>Spencer</span> rose to answer: ‘I remember that
two of the Earl’s ancestors—the Earl of <span class='sc'>Surrey</span>, and
the Duke of <span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>, were unjustly condemned to death,
without being heard.’ The implied parallel was a silly one,
but its weakness and irrelevancy did not restrain <span class='sc'>Arundel’s</span>
anger. ‘My Lords,’ said he, ‘I do acknowledge that my
ancestors have suffered. It may be for doing the king and
the country good service; and at such time, perhaps, as
when the ancestors of the Lord that spake last kept sheep.’
The speaker failed to see that by using such words he had
committed exactly the same offence as that for which he had,
but a moment before, censured the late Attorney-General,
and had moved the House to punish him. On all sides, he
was advised to apologise. He resisted all entreaty. When
committed to the Tower, he still refused submission.
Both the King and the Prince of Wales had to intercede
for him with the House before he could regain his
liberty.</p>

<p class='c035'>With rare exception, the public incidents of <span class='sc'>Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Arundel’s</span> life during the remainder of the reign of <span class='sc'>James</span>
are such as offer little interest, save as illustrations of character.
In that respect, many of them testify to the failing
which appears so strikingly in the story of the quarrel with
Lord <span class='sc'>Spencer</span>. Some noble qualities lost part of their real
lustre when pride was so plainly seen in their company.
All that was best in Lord <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> revolted at the grossness
of the Stuart court. He often increased his own disgust
by contrasting what he saw at Whitehall with the memories
of his youth. His office of Earl Marshal precluded him
from very long absences. Sometimes, when forced to mingle
with courtiers for whose society he had little liking, he
rebuked their want of dignity by exaggerating his own
dignity into haughtiness. Against failings of this kind we
have to set many merits, and amongst them a merit eminently
rare in that age. <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> was free from covetousness—save
in that special sense in which covetousness, it
may be feared, cleaves to all ‘collectorship.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Adventure of Lady Arundel at Venice.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>In 1622 some anxiety was occasioned to Lord <span class='sc'>Arundel</span>
by a singular adventure which befell his wife during her
residence in the Venetian territory, whither (in the course
of a long Italian tour) she had gone to watch over the education
of their sons; little anticipating, it may well be supposed,
that her name and that of Lord <span class='sc'>Arundel</span>, would be
made to figure in Venetian records in connection with the
strange story of the conspirator Antonio <span class='sc'>Foscarini</span>.</p>

<p class='c029'>After making some stay in Venice, Lady <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> had
taken a villa on the Brenta, about ten miles from the City.</p>

<p class='c029'>In April, 1622, she was on her way from this villa to
the Mocenigo Palace, her residence in Venice, when she was
met by the Secretary of Sir Henry <span class='sc'>Wotton</span>, English ambassador
to the Republic. The secretary said that he was sent
by the ambassador to inform her that the Venetian Senate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>had resolved to command her ladyship to leave their city
and territory within a few days, on the ground of a discovery
that <span class='sc'>Foscarini</span> had carried on some of his traitorous
intrigues with foreign ministers—and more especially with
those of the Pope and Emperor—at her house.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1622, April.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
To this the
messenger added, that it was Sir Henry <span class='sc'>Wotton’s</span> most
earnest advice that Lady <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> should not return to
Venice, but should remain at Dolo, until she heard from him
again. Having listened to this strange communication
in private, she desired the secretary to repeat it in the
presence of some of the persons who attended her. Then
she hastened to the ambassador’s house at Venice. Her
interview with <span class='sc'>Wotton</span> is thus, in substance, narrated by
Lord <span class='sc'>Arundel</span>, when telling the story to his friend the Earl
of <span class='sc'>Carlisle</span>, then ambassador to the Court of France.</p>

<p class='c029'>‘Lady <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> went immediately to my Lord Ambassador
[<span class='sc'>Wotton</span>], telling him she came to hear from his
own mouth what she had heard from his servant’s.’ When
Sir Henry had repeated the statement of his secretary, the
Lady asked him how long the accusation and the resolution
of the Senate had been known to him. He replied
that reports of the alleged intercourse with <span class='sc'>Foscarini</span> had
reached him some fifteen days before, or more; but that
of the resolution of the Senate he had heard only on that
morning. ‘She asked him why he did never let her understand
of the report all that time? He said because she
spake not to him of it.’ To Lady <span class='sc'>Arundel’s</span> pithy rejoinder
that it would have been hard for her to speak of a
matter of which she had never heard the least rumour until
that day, and to her further protestation that she had not
even seen <span class='sc'>Foscarini</span> since the time of his visit to England,
some years earlier, Sir Henry replied, ‘I believe there
was no such matter;’ but he refused to disclose the name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>of the person who had first spoken to him of the accusation.
To his renewed advice that her ladyship should not stir
farther in the matter, she declined to accede.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MS. <span class='sc'>Addit.</span>,
4176, § 156.
(B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It concerned
her honour, and her husband’s honour, she said, to have
public conference with the Doge and Council without
delay. From carrying out this resolve the ambassador
found it impossible to dissuade her.</p>

<p class='c029'>That conference took place on the following day with the
remarkable result of a public declaration by the Doge that
no mention had ever been made of Lady <span class='sc'>Arundel’s</span> name,
or of the name of any person nearly or remotely connected
with her, either at any stage of the proceedings against
<span class='sc'>Foscarini</span>, or in any of the discussions which had arisen
out of his conspiracy.</p>

<p class='c029'>When the audience given to Lady <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> by the
Doge had been made the subject of a communication to the
Senate, that body instructed the Venetian Ambassador in
England to confer with Lord <span class='sc'>Arundel</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Deliberations of the Senate of Venice</i>; printed by Hardy, in <i>Report on Venetian Archives</i>, pp. 78–84 (1866).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘You are,’ said
they, ‘to speak to the Earl Marshal in such strong and
earnest language that he may retain no doubt of the invalidity
of the report, and may remain perfectly convinced
of the esteem and cordial affection entertained towards him
by the Republic; augmented as such feelings are by the
open and dignified mode of life led here by the Countess,
and in which she hastens the education of her sons in the
sciences to make them—as they will become—faithful
imitators of their meritorious father and their ancestors.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Sir Henry <span class='sc'>Wotton’s</span> motive in the strange part taken
by him in this incident is nowhere disclosed. He had to
listen to several indirect reproofs, both from the Doge and
from the Senate, which were none the less incisive on
account of the courtly language in which they were
couched.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Two years afterwards, the Earl was himself hastily summoned
to the Continent to attend the death-bed of his
eldest son, James, Lord <span class='sc'>Maltravers</span>, who is described by
a contemporary writer as a ‘gentleman of rare wit and extraordinary
expectation.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Death of Arundel’s eldest son.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The Countess and her two elder
sons, James and Henry, were then returning from Italy to
England.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Royal license to travel</i>, July, 1624.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
They passed through Belgium in order to visit
the Queen of <span class='sc'>Bohemia</span>. Whilst at Ghent, upon the journey,
Lord <span class='sc'>Maltravers</span> was seized with the smallpox. He
died in that city in July, 1624. The affliction was acutely
felt.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Domestic Corresp.</i> James I, vol. cxlix, § 67; vol. clii, § 55.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘My sorrow makes me incapable of this world’s
affairs,’ wrote the Earl to one of his political correspondents,
in the autumn of the year. To the outer world, reserved
manners and a stately demeanour often gave a very false
impression of the man himself. Throughout his life,
<span class='sc'>Arundel’s</span> affectionate nature was so evinced in his deeds,
and in his domestic intercourse, as to stand in little need
of illustration from his words. Mainly, as it seems, to this
characteristic quality he was soon to owe a second imprisonment
in the Tower of London.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Stuart Marriage and its Results.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The new Lord <span class='sc'>Maltravers</span> shortly after his return to
England fell in love with the Lady Elizabeth <span class='sc'>Stuart</span>,
daughter of Esme, Duke of <span class='sc'>Lennox</span>. <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> had formed
other wishes and plans for the son who was now his heir,
and there is evidence that he was reluctant to give his consent
to the prosecution of the suit. Nor did the kinship of
the prospective bride with King <span class='sc'>Charles</span> appear to him,
it seems, at all an inviting circumstance in the matter. So
long as <span class='sc'>Buckingham</span> stood at the helm of affairs <span class='sc'>Arundel</span>
was likely to have a very small share in the new king’s
affections, so that pride and policy as well as inclination
stood in the way of his approval. He knew also that it
was <span class='sc'>Charles’</span> eager wish that his kinswoman should marry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Lord <span class='sc'>Lorne</span>, the eldest son of the Earl of <span class='sc'>Argyle</span>. But
the young lover was ardent, and his entreaties unintermitting.
At length, we are told, he not only wrung from
the Earl the words ‘You may try your fortune with the
lady that you seem to love so well,’ but prevailed upon him
to confer paternally on the subject with the lady’s aunt and
guardian, the Duchess of <span class='sc'>Richmond</span>. <span class='sc'>Maltravers</span>, meanwhile,
had resolved to incur no risk of defeat by waiting
for a royal assent to his marriage. He had long before
won his cause with the lady, but had kept the secret.
Two passionate lovers<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c030'><sup>[32]</sup></a> went gravely through the ceremony
of a formal introduction to each other.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Maltravers</span> then induced her to consent to a private
marriage. When Lord <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> was informed of the fact
he immediately disclosed his knowledge to the King, and
besought pardon for the culprits. But <span class='sc'>Charles’</span> wrath
was unbounded. He placed the new-married pair under
restraint in London. He committed <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> himself to
the Tower. He commanded Lady <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> to remain at
Horsley, in Surrey, a seat belonging to the Dowager
Countess, her mother-in-law.</p>

<p class='c029'>When Lord <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> was thus imprisoned Parliament
was sitting. The Lords declared his arrest to be an infringement
of their privileges. The King replied that ‘the
Earl of <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> is restrained for a misdemeanour which
is personal to the King’s Majesty, and has no relation to
matters of Parliament.’ The Lords still insisted that it
was the Earl’s unquestionable right ‘to be admitted to
come, sit, and serve in Parliament.’ <span class='sc'>Charles</span> released
<span class='sc'>Arundel</span> from the Tower, and then confined him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Horsley. Royal evasion did but provoke increased earnestness
and firmness from the Peers. At length they resolved
that they would suspend public business until the Earl
presented himself in his place.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Secretary Conway’s Letter Book</i>, pp. 251 seqq. (R. H.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Nearly three months had
been spent in debate and altercation before Secretary
<span class='sc'>Conway</span> was directed to write to <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> in these terms:
‘It is the King’s pleasure that you come to the Parliament,
but not to the Court.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Lords’ Journals</i>, vol. iii, p. 653, &amp;c.</div>

<p class='c029'>The sequel of the story, as it tells itself in the State
Papers, affords an early and eminent illustration of the
qualities in <span class='sc'>Charles the First</span> which, as they ripened,
brought about his ruin. The King resolved that his concession
should as far as was possible be retracted. Directly
the sitting of Parliament was suspended, the King commanded
<span class='sc'>Conway</span> to apprise the Earl that his restraint to
Horsley was renewed, ‘as before the Earl’s leave to come
to Parliament.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Domestic Corresp.</i>, Charles I, vol. xxxv, p. 16 (R. H.).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>Arundel</span> on his part made courtly and
even lavish declarations of submission. ‘I desire to implore
the King’s grace by the humblest and best ways I
can.’ This was written in September, 1626. Whenever
it was indispensable that he should obtain leave to visit the
capital a petition had to be prepared. In March, 1627, he
writes: ‘The King has limited my stay in London until
the 12th of March. I will obey, but I beg you to represent
to His Majesty that I have necessary business to
transact&#160;... and that I have so carried myself as to
shew my desire to give His Majesty no distastes. If now,
after a year has passed, the King will dissolve this cloud,
and leave me to my own liberty, I will hold myself to be
most free when living in such place and manner as may be
most to His Majesty’s liking.’ It was all in vain. Another
whole year passes. <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> has still to write: ‘I beseech
the King to give life to my just desires, and after two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>years of heavy disfavour to grant me the happiness to kiss
his hands and to attend him in my place.’ To this humble
representation and entreaty it was replied by Secretary
<span class='sc'>Conway</span>: ‘His Majesty’s answer is that the Earl has not
so far appeased the exceptions which the King has taken
against unkindness conceived, as yet to take off his disfavour.

As for the Earl’s proffered duty and carriage in
the King’s service, the King will judge of that as he shall
find occasion.’</p>

<p class='c029'>He found occasion ere long; but not until after <span class='sc'>Buckingham’s</span>
death. <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> rendered useful service, on
some conspicuous occasions, both at home and abroad. If
his successive diplomatic missions to Holland in 1632, and
to Ratisbon in 1638, on the affairs of the Palatinate, failed
of their main object, it was from no miscarriage of the
ambassador. In the unostentatious labours of the Council
Board he took during a long series of years a very honourable
share. And it is much to his honour that by the men
to whom the chief scandals of a disastrous reign are mainly
ascribable, <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> was, almost uniformly, both disliked
and feared.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Arundel and Strafford.</span></div>

<div class='sidenote'>1641. March and April.</div>

<p class='c029'>As Lord High Steward of England, <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> had to
preside at the trial of the Earl of <span class='sc'>Strafford</span>. He acquitted
himself of an arduous task with eminent ability, and with
an impartiality which won respect, alike from the managers
of the impeachment and from the friends of the doomed
statesman. The only person who expressed dissatisfaction
with <span class='sc'>Arundel’s</span> conduct on that critical occasion was the
King. The historians who have most deeply and acutely
scanned the details of that most memorable of all our State
Trials are agreed that in order to have satisfied <span class='sc'>Charles</span>,
the Earl of <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> must have betrayed the duty of his
high office.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Shortly after the trial of <span class='sc'>Strafford</span>, it became <span class='sc'>Arundel’s</span>
duty as Earl Marshal to attend the mother of the queen
(<span class='sc'>Mary</span> of Medicis), on her return to Holland; and he
received the King’s license to remain beyond the seas
during his pleasure.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Latest Employments.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He returned however to England in
October of the same year.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Rushworth, vol. iv, pp. 317, 318.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In the following February, a
similar ceremonial mission was his last official employment.
He then conducted Queen <span class='sc'>Henrietta Maria</span> on her journey
into France, and took his own last farewell of England.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1642. February.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It
was an unconscious farewell.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sir E. Walker, in MS. Harl., as before.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Nor does his departure
appear to have been dictated by any desire to shrink from
sacrifices on behalf of the cause with which—whether
rightly or wrongly—all his personal sympathies, as well as
the political views of his whole life, were bound up. At
the hands of the first <span class='sc'>Stuart</span> he had met with capricious
favour, and with enduring injustice. By the second,
during several years, he was treated with marked and
causeless indignity; and then, during several other years,
rewarded grudgingly for zealous service. In exile, his contributions
in support of the royal cause were upon a scale
which impoverished both himself and his family.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c030'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c029'>Such a fact is a conclusive proof of magnanimity of
spirit, whatever may be thought of its bearings in regard to
political insight.

Opinion is less likely to differ with respect
to exertions of quite another order which occasionally
occupied Lord <span class='sc'>Arundel’s</span> mind and energies
during at least twenty years of his political life.</p>

<p class='c029'>One of the best known incidents in his varied career is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>also one of its most honourable incidents. His friendship
for <span class='sc'>Ralegh</span> grew out of a deep interest in colonization.
And the calamitous issue of that famous voyage to Guiana
in 1617 which <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> had promoted was very far from
inducing him to abandon the earnest advocacy of a resumption,
in subsequent years, of the enterprise which
<span class='sc'>Ralegh</span> had had so much at heart. His efforts were more
than once repeated, but the same influences which ruined
<span class='sc'>Ralegh</span> foiled the exertions of <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> and of those who
worked with him.</p>

<p class='c029'>He then turned his attention towards the wide field of
colonial enterprise which presented itself in New England.
From the autumn of 1620 until the summer of 1635 he, from
time to time, actively supported the endeavours of the
‘Council for the Planting of New England.’

‘that our endeavours to advance the plantation of New
England have been attended with frequent troubles and
great disappointments. We have been deprived of near
friends and faithful servants employed in that work. We
have been assaulted with sharp litigious questions before
the Privy Council by the Virginia Company, who had complained
to Parliament that our Plantation was a grievance.’
They proceed to say that a promising settlement which
had been established, under the governorship of Captain
<span class='sc'>Gorges</span> in Massachusetts Bay, had been violently broken
up by a body of speculative intruders who, without the
knowledge of the Council of New England, had found
means to obtain a royal ‘grant of some three thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>miles of the sea-coast.’ Finding it by far too great a task,
for their means, to restore what had thus been brought to
ruin, <span class='sc'>Arundel</span>, and his fellow-councillors were constrained
to resign their charter.</p>

<p class='c029'>Four years later the Earl formed an elaborate plan for
the colonization of Madagascar. But the events of 1639–40
soon made its effectual prosecution hopeless.</p>

<p class='c035'>The latest notice we have of the Earl of <span class='sc'>Arundel</span>, from
the hand of any eminent contemporary, occurs in the Diary
of John <span class='sc'>Evelyn</span>, and is dated six months before the Earl’s
death.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Death at Padua</span>, 1646.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In June of the preceding year (1645) <span class='sc'>Evelyn</span> had
paid a visit to Lord <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> at his house in Padua, and
had then accompanied him to a famous garden in that city
known as the ‘Garden of Mantua.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Evelyn, <i>Diary</i>, vol. 1, p. 212.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
They had also explored
together some ancient ruins lying near the Palace of Foscari
all’ Arena. When <span class='sc'>Evelyn</span> renewed his visit in March,
1646, the Earl was no longer able to leave the house.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 218, 219.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘I
took my leave of him,’ says the diarist, ‘in his bed, where
I left that great and excellent man in tears, on some private
discourse of crosses that had befallen his family, particularly
the undutifulness of his grandson, Philip, turning Dominican
friar; and the misery of his country, now embroiled
in civil war. He caused his gentleman to give me directions,
written with his own hand, what curiosities I should
inquire after in my journey; and so—enjoyning me to
write sometimes to him—I departed.’ The Earl died at
Padua on the 24th September, 1646, having entered into
the sixty-second year of his age. In compliance with the
directions of his Will his remains were brought to England
and buried at Arundel.</p>

<p class='c035'>It remains only to add a few particulars of the character
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>and sources of the splendid collections which the Earl of
<span class='sc'>Arundel</span>, by the persistent labours and the lavish expenditure
of more than thirty years, had amassed. The surviving
materials for such an account are, however, very
fragmentary.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Notices of the Arundelian Collections.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Those which are of chief interest occur in the
correspondence which passed between the Earl and Sir
Thomas <span class='sc'>Roe</span> during the embassy of that eminent diplomatist
to the Ottoman Porte in the years 1626–1628.</p>

<p class='c029'>The Earl’s zeal as a collector, and the public attention
which his personal successes in that character during his
Italian travels had soon attracted, naturally excited a like
ambition on the part of several of his contemporaries.
Conspicuous in this respect were his brother-in-law the
Earl of <span class='sc'>Pembroke</span>, and his political rival and enemy the
Duke of <span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>. <span class='sc'>Arundel’s</span> success in amassing
many fine pictures had, in like manner, already attracted
the attention of Prince <span class='sc'>Charles</span> to that peculiarly fascinating
branch of collectorship.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Correspondence with Sir Thomas Roe.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>When Sir Thomas <span class='sc'>Roe</span> set out for Constantinople he
was charged with commissions to search for antiquities on
<span class='sc'>Buckingham’s</span> behalf, as well as on Lord <span class='sc'>Arundel’s</span>.
He was himself a novice in such inquiries. He had to
encounter excessive difficulties from the jealousy, and sometimes
the dishonesty, of the Turkish and other agents whom
he was obliged to employ. Most of them were stubborn in
their belief that a search for old marbles did but mask the
pursuit of buried treasure of greater currency. And to
difficulties of this sort was added a standing fear that every
service rendered to the Earl Marshal might be esteemed an
offence to the powerful favourite at Whitehall.</p>

<p class='c029'>To an urgent letter which he had received from <span class='sc'>Arundel</span>
just as he was embarking, Sir Thomas replied, from Constantinople,
in January, 1622. ‘I moved our Consul, Richard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span><span class='sc'>Milward</span>, at Scio, whom I found prepared and ready,’ he
reports. ‘We conferred about “the Maid of Smirna”
which he cannot yet obteyne, without an especiall command
[from the Porte]. I brought with mee from Messina
the Bishop of Andre, one of the islands of the Arches, a
man of good learning and great experience in these parts.
Hee assured mee that the search after old and good authors
was utterly vaine.... The last French ambassador had
the last gleanings. Only of some few he gave mee notice
as of an old Tertullian, and a piece of Chrisostome&#160;...
which may be procured to be copied, but not the originall....
Concerning antiquities in marbles, there are many in
divers parts, but especially at Delphos, unesteemed here,
and, I doubt not, easy to be procured for the charge of
digging and fetching, which must be purposely undertaken.
It is supposed that many statues are buried to secure them
from the envy of the Turks, and that, leave obteyned,
[they] would come to light, which I will endeavour as soon
as I am warm here.’ After mentioning that he had already
procured some coins, he adds, with amusing naïveté, ‘I
have also a stone, taken out of the old pallace of Priam in
Troy, cutt in horned shape, but because I neither can tell
of what it is, nor hath it any other bewty but only the
antiquity and truth of being a peece of that ruined and
famous building, I will not presume to send it you.

Arundel,
27 Jan.,
1621 [O. S.];
<i>Negotiations</i>,
p. 16.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Yet
I have delivered it to the same messenger, that your Lordship
may see it and throw it away.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Two years afterwards the ambassador has to tell Lord
<span class='sc'>Arundel</span> a mingled story of failure and success: ‘The
command you required for the Greeke to be sent into
Morea I have sollicitted [of] two viziers, one after the
other, butt they both rejected mee and gave answere, that
it was no tyme to graunt such priviledges. Neare to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>port they have not so great doubt and therefore I have
prevailed with another, and [have] sent Mr. <span class='sc'>Markham</span>,
assisted with a letter from the Caplen Bassa, whose jurisdiction
extends to all the islands and sea-ports....
On Asia side, about Troy, Zizicum, and all the way to
Aleppo, are innumerable pillars, statues, and tombstones of
marble, with inscriptions in Greeke.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ibid.</i>, 10 May, 1623, <i>Negotiations</i>, p. 154.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
These may be fetcht
at charge, and secrettly; butt yf wee ask leave it cannot
be obteyned; therefore Mr. <span class='sc'>Markham</span> will use discretion
rather then power, and so the Turks will bring them for
their proffitt.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Roe’s</span> report encouraged Lord <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> to send an
agent, named <span class='sc'>Petty</span>, on a special exploring mission into
various parts of the Ottoman Empire. The agent thus
selected was eminently fitted for his task, and showed
himself to be a man of untiring industry. Very soon after
<span class='sc'>Petty’s</span> arrival at Constantinople, Sir Thomas <span class='sc'>Roe</span> wrote
to the Duke of <span class='sc'>Buckingham</span> an account of his successful
researches, and he prefaced it with an acknowledgement
that ‘by conference with Mr. <span class='sc'>Petty</span>, sent hither by my
Lord of <span class='sc'>Arundell</span>, I have somewhat bettered my sckill
in such figures. We have searched all this cyttye,’ he proceeds
to say, ‘and found nothing but upon one gate, called
anciently <i>Porta Aurea</i>, built by <span class='sc'>Constantine</span>, bewtifyed
with two mighty pillars, and upon the sides and over it,
twelve tables of fine marble cutt into historyes,—some of
a very great relevo, sett into the wall with small pillars as
supporters. Most of the figures are equall; some above
the life some less.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Roe to the Duke of Buckingham, 11 May, 1625, <i>Negotiations</i>, pp. 386–7.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
They are—in my eye—extremely
decayed, but Mr. <span class='sc'>Petty</span> doth so prayse them, as that he
hath not seene much better in the great and costly collections
of Italye.... The fower to which I have most
affection&#160;... are both brave and sweete.... The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>relevo so high that they are almost statues, and doe but
seeme to sticke to the ground.’</p>

<p class='c029'>In October of the same year Sir <span class='sc'>Thomas</span> sent an elaborate
account to the Earl of <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> of the progress made
by <span class='sc'>Petty</span>, and of his own exertions to provide him with
every possible facility.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The proposed partition of ancient marbles between Arundel and Buckingham.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He told the Earl of the difficulty of
his own position towards the Duke of <span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>, and
besought him to admit of an arrangement by which the
product of the joint exertions of ambassador and agent
should be divided between the competitors. <span class='sc'>Petty</span>, he
reports, ‘hath visited Pergamo, Samos, Ephesus, and some
other places, where he hath made your Lordship great provisions....
I have given him forceable commands, and
letters of recommendation from the Patriarch. I have bene
free and open to him in whatsoever I knewe, and so I will
continue for your Lordship’s command. But your Lordship
knowing that I have received the like from the Duke
of <span class='sc'>Buckingham</span>, and engaged my word to doe him service
hee might judge it want of witt, or will, or creditt, if Mr.
<span class='sc'>Petty</span>, who could doe nothing but by mee, should take all
things before or from mee. Therefore to avoid all emulation,
and that I might stand clear before two so great and
honourable patrons, I thought I had made agreement with
him for all our advantages. Therefore we resolved to take
down those sixe mentioned relevos on <i>Porta Aurea</i>, and
I proceeded so far as I offered 600 dollars for four of
them, to bee divided between his Grace and your Lordship
by lotts. And if your Lordship liked not the price,
Mr. <span class='sc'>Petty</span> had his choice to forsake them. But now, I
perceave, he hath entitled your Lordship to them all by
some right that, if I could gett them, it were an injury to
divide them.... But I am sorry wee strive for the
shadowe. Your Lordship may beleeve an honest man, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>your servant, I have tried the bassa,—the capteyne of the
Castle,—the overseer of the Grand Signor’s works,—the
soldiours that make that watch,—and none of them dare
meddle. They [the sculptures] stand between two mighty
pillars of marble, on other tables of marble supported with
less pillars, uppon the cheife port of the Citty, the entrance
by the Castle called “The Seaven Towres,” which was
never opened since the Greeke Emperour lost it, but a
counterscarfe and another wall built before it....
There is butt one way left in the world, which I will practice....

Arundel,
30 Oct, 1625;
<i>Negotiations</i>,
pp. 444–446.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If I gett them not, I will pronounce [that] no
man, no ambassadour, shall ever bee able to doe it;—except,
also, the Grand Signor, for want, will sell the
Castle.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Just before the date of this letter <span class='sc'>Petty</span> had suffered
shipwreck on the coast of Asia, when returning from
Samos. Together with his papers and personal baggage,
he lost the fruits of long and successful researches. But
his inexhaustible energies enabled him to recover what, to
the men about him, seemed to have hopelessly perished.
He found means to raise the buried marbles from the
wreck.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ibid.</i>, 7 April, 1626, p. 495.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘There was never man,’ wrote Sir Thomas <span class='sc'>Roe</span>,
with the frank admiration of a congenial spirit, ‘so fitted
to an employment; that encounters all accidents with so
unwearied patience; eates with Greekes on their worst
dayes; lyes with fishermen on plancks, at the best; is all
thinges to all men, that he may obteyne his ends, which
are your Lordship’s service.’</p>

<p class='c029'>To Dr. <span class='sc'>Goade</span>, one of the chaplains of Archbishop
<span class='sc'>Abbot</span>, Sir Thomas <span class='sc'>Roe</span> continued the narrative of <span class='sc'>Petty’s</span>
zealous researches, and of the success which attended them.
‘By my means,’ he wrote, ‘Mr. <span class='sc'>Petty</span> had admittance into
the best library known of Greece, where are loades of old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>manuscripts, and hee used so fine arte, with the helpe of
some of my servants, that hee conveyed away twenty two.
I thought I should have had my share, but hee was for himselfe.
Hee is a good chooser; saw all, or most, and tooke,
I thincke, those that were and wilbe of greate esteeme. Hee
speaketh sparingly of such a bootye, but could not conteyne
sometyme to discover with joy his treasure.... I meant
to have a review of that librarye, but hee gave it such a
blow under my trust that, since, it hath been locked up
under two keys, whereof one kept by the townsmen that
have interest or oversight of the monastery, so that I could
do no good....
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ib.</i>, p. 500.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
My hope is to deale with the Patriarch,
and not to trust to myselfe, and to chances.’</p>

<p class='c029'>In November, 1626, Sir Thomas further informed the
Duke of <span class='sc'>Buckingham</span> that ‘Mr. <span class='sc'>Petty</span> hath raked together
two hundred peices [of sculpture], all broken, or few
[of them] entyre.... Hee had this advantage, that hee
went himselfe into all the islands, and tooke all he saw, and
is now gon to Athens.’

In subsequent letters and despatches
the diplomatist returns often to this unofficial branch of his
duties, and makes it very apparent that <span class='sc'>Petty’s</span> zeal had,
for a time, spoiled the market of the agents who followed
in his track.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Lord Arundel’s researches in Italy.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Lord <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> was not less ably served by the factors
and representatives whom he employed in Italy, in Germany,
and in the Netherlands. But the story is far too
long to be told in detail.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MSS. at Norfolk House; printed, in Tierney’s <i>Arundel</i>, p. 489.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Their success in collecting choice
pictures and other works of art was so conspicuous that
when one of them had an interview with <span class='sc'>Rubens</span> at
Antwerp, to give a commission from Lord <span class='sc'>Arundel</span>, the
great painter—himself, it will be remembered, an eminent
collector also—said to him: ‘I regard the Earl in the light
of an evangelist to the world of art, and as the great supporter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>of our profession.’ In these artistic commissions and
researches William <span class='sc'>Trumbull</span>, Edward <span class='sc'>Norgate</span>, Sir John
<span class='sc'>Borough</span>, and Sir Isaac <span class='sc'>Wake</span>, especially distinguished
themselves. Their correspondence with Lord <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> is
spread over a long series of years, and it abounds with
curious illustrations of ‘the world of art,’ as it lived and
moved in the earlier part of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p class='c029'>Among those entire collections which the Earl purchased
in bulk, two are more particularly notable—the museum,
namely, of Daniel <span class='sc'>Nice</span>, and the library of the family of
<span class='sc'>Pirckheimer</span> of Nuremberg.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Nice’s</span> Museum was especially rich in medals and gems.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Evelyn to Pepys; <i>Diary and Corresp.</i>, vol. iii, p. 300.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If <span class='sc'>Evelyn’s</span> information about the circumstances of that
acquisition was accurate, it cost the Earl the sum—enormous,
at that date—of ten thousand pounds. I cannot, however,
but suspect that into that statement some error of figures
has crept.</p>

<p class='c029'>The acquisition of the <span class='sc'>Pirckheimer</span> Library was made
by the Earl himself, during his diplomatic mission into
Germany on the affairs of the Palatinate. In this collection
some of the choicest of the Arundelian MSS. which now
enrich the British Museum were comprised. Its foundation
had been laid more than a hundred and thirty years
before the date of the Earl’s purchase. But part of the
library of the first founder had passed into the possession
of the City of Nuremberg. The collection which Lord
<span class='sc'>Arundel</span> acquired was rich both in classical manuscripts
and in the materials of mediæval history.</p>

<p class='c029'>The liberality with which these varied treasures, as they
successively arrived in London, were made accessible to
scholars was in harmony with the open-handedness by
means of which they had been amassed. For a few years
Arundel House was itself an anticipatory ‘British Museum.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Then came the civil war. But the injury which the <span class='sc'>Arundel</span>
collections sustained from the insecurity and commotions of
a turbulent time is very insignificant, in comparison with
that sustained, after the Restoration, through the ignorance
and the indolence of an unworthy inheritor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Successors of Lord Arundel.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The immediate heir and successor of Earl Thomas survived
his father less than six years. He died at Arundel
House in April, 1652, leaving several sons, of whom the
two eldest, Thomas and Henry, became successively Earls
of Arundel and Dukes of Norfolk. The first of these was
restored to the dukedom in 1660. But the whole of his
life, after attaining manhood, was passed in Italy and under
the heavy affliction of impaired mental faculties, following
upon an attack of brain-fever which had seized him at
Padua, in 1645. He never recovered, but died in the city
in which the disease had stricken him, lingering until the
year 1677. It was in consequence of this calamity that the
inheritance of a large portion of the Arundelian collections,
and also the possession of Arundel House in London, passed
from Earl Henry-Frederick to his second son, Henry.</p>

<p class='c035'>We learn from many passages both in the Diary and in
the Letters of John <span class='sc'>Evelyn</span> that, under the new owner,
Arundel House and its contents were so neglected as, at
times, to lie at the mercy of a crowd of rapacious parasites.
In one place he speaks of the mansion as being infested by
‘painters, panders, and misses.’ In another he describes
the library as suffering by repeated depredations. He
remonstrated with the owner, and at length obtained
from him a gift of the library for the newly-founded
Royal Society, and a gift of part of the marbles for the
University of Oxford. In his Diary he thus narrates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>the circumstances under which these benefactions were
made:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Gift of the Arundel Library to the Royal Society</span>;</div>

<p class='c029'>Having mentioned that on the destruction of the
meeting-place of the Royal Society, its members ‘were
invited by Mr. <span class='sc'>Howard</span> to sit at Arundel House in the
Strand,’ he proceeds to say that Mr. <span class='sc'>Howard</span>, ‘at my
instigation, likewise bestowed on the Society that noble
library which his grandfather especially, and his ancestors,
had collected. This gentleman had so little inclination to
books that it was the preservation of them from embezzlement.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Evelyn, <i>Diary, &amp;c.</i>, vol. ii, p. 20.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Elsewhere he says that not a few books had
actually been lost before, by his interference, the bulk
of the collection was thus saved. The gift to the Royal
Society was made at the close of the year 1666.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>and that of the Marbles to the University of Oxford</span>.</div>

<p class='c029'>In September of the following year this entry occurs in
the same Diary:—‘[I went] to London, on the 19th, with
Mr. Henry <span class='sc'>Howard</span> of Norfolk, of whom I obtained the
gift of his Arundelian Marbles,—those celebrated and
famous inscriptions, Greek and Latin, gathered with so
much cost and industry from Greece by his illustrious
grandfather the magnificent Earl of <span class='sc'>Arundel</span>.... When
I saw these precious monuments miserably neglected, and
scattered up and down about the garden and other parts of
Arundel House, and how exceedingly the corrosive air of
London impaired them, I procured him to bestow them on
the University of Oxford. This he was pleased to grant
me, and now gave me the key of the gallery, with leave to
mark all those stones, urns, altars, &amp;c., and whatever I
found had inscriptions on them, that were not statues.
This I did, and getting them removed and piled together,
with those which were encrusted in the garden-walls, I
sent immediately letters to the Vice-Chancellor of what I
had procured.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ib.</i>, p. 29. (edit. 1850.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
On the 8th of October he records a visit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>from the President of Trinity, ‘to thank me, in the name
of the Vice-Chancellor and the whole University, and to
receive my directions what was to be done to show their
gratitude to Mr. <span class='sc'>Howard</span>.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Ten months later, <span class='sc'>Evelyn</span> records that he was called
to London to wait upon the Duke of <span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>. The
Duke, he says, ‘having, at my sole request, bestowed the
Arundelian Library on the Royal Society, sent to me to
take charge of the books and remove them.... Many
of these books had been presented by Popes, Cardinals,
and great persons, to the Earls of <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> and Dukes of
<span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>; and the late magnificent Earl of <span class='sc'>Arundel</span>
bought a noble library in Germany which is in this collection.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ib.</i>, pp. 122, 123.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
I should not, for the honour I bear the family,
have persuaded the Duke to part with these, had I not
seen how negligent he was of them; suffering the priests
and everybody to carry away and dispose of what they
pleased, so that abundance of rare things are irrecoverably
gone.’</p>

<p class='c029'>A curious narrative communicated, almost a century afterwards,
to the Society of Antiquaries, by James <span class='sc'>Theobald</span>,
proves that in this respect the gallery of antiquities—notwithstanding
the noble benefaction to Oxford—was even
more unfortunate than the library of books. At the time
when these gifts were obtained for Oxford and for the
Royal Society, another extensive portion of the original collections
had already passed into the possession of William
<span class='sc'>Howard</span>, Viscount Stafford, and had been removed to
Stafford House. Lord <span class='sc'>Stafford</span> was a younger son of the
collector, and appears to have received the choice artistic
treasures which long adorned his town residence by the
gift of his mother.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Dispersion of part of the Arundel Marbles.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
According to <span class='sc'>Evelyn</span>, Lady <span class='sc'>Arundel</span>
also ‘scattered and squandered away innumerable other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>rarities,&#160;... whilst my Lord was in Italy.’ But in this
instance he appears to speak by hearsay, rather than from
personal knowledge. <span class='sc'>Tierney</span>, the able and painstaking
historian of the family, asserts that its records contain no
proof whatever of the justice of the charge.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>History of Arundel</i>, p. 509.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And he traces
the origin of <span class='sc'>Evelyn’s</span> statement to a passage in one of the
letters of Francis <span class='sc'>Junius</span>, in which it is said of Lady
<span class='sc'>Arundel</span> that she ‘carried over a vast treasure of rarities,
and convaighed them away out of England.’ Even to
<span class='sc'>Junius</span>, notwithstanding his connection with the family,
the charge may have come but as a rumour.</p>

<p class='c029'>Be that as it may, the subsequent dispersion of many
treasures of art which the Earl had collected with such
unwearied pains and lavish expenditure is unquestionable.</p>

<p class='c029'>Lord Henry <span class='sc'>Howard</span>, it has been shown, excepted the
‘statues’ from his gift to the University. They remained
at Arundel House, but so little care was bestowed upon
their preservation that when the same owner afterwards
obtained an Act of Parliament empowering him to build
streets on part of the site of Arundel House and Gardens,
many of these statues were broken by the throwing upon
or near them of heaps of rubbish from the excavations
made, in the years 1678 and 1679, for the new buildings.
These broken statues and fragments retained beauty enough
to attract from time to time the admiration of educated eyes
when such eyes chanced to fall upon them. Those which
long adorned the seat of the Earls of <span class='sc'>Pomfret</span>, at Easton
Neston, in Oxfordshire, were purchased by Sir William
<span class='sc'>Fermor</span>, and were given to the University of Oxford by
one of his descendants. Others which are, or were, at
Fawley Court, near Henley, were purchased by Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span><span class='sc'>Freeman</span>. Others, again, were bought by Edmund <span class='sc'>Waller</span>,
the poet, for the decoration of Beaconsfield.</p>

<p class='c029'>Still more strange was the fate which befell certain other
marbles which Lord Henry (by that time Duke of <span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>)
caused to be removed from Arundel House to a
piece of waste ground belonging to the manor of Kennington.
These the owner seems to have regarded as little
better than lumber. It is therefore the less surprising that
his servants took so little care of them as to suffer them to
be buried, in their turn, beneath rubbish which had been
brought to Kennington from St. Paul’s, during the rebuilding
of that cathedral. By-and-bye, precious marbles, excavated
amidst so many difficulties arising from Turkish barbarism
in Asia Minor, had to be re-excavated in England.
Many years after their second burial, some rumour of the
circumstance came to the knowledge of the Earl of <span class='sc'>Burlington</span>,
and by his efforts and care something was
recovered. But the researches then made were, in some
way, interrupted. They were afterwards resumed by Lord
<span class='sc'>Petre</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Narrative by Theobald; printed in <span class='sc'>Anecdotes of Howard Family</span>, pp. 101–120.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘After six days’ of excavation and search, says an
eye-witness, ‘just as the workmen were going to give over,
they fell upon something which gave them hopes. Upon
further opening the ground they discovered six statues,&#160;... some of a colossal size, the drapery of which was
thought to be exceeding fine.’ These went eventually to
Worksop.</p>

<p class='c029'>Some Arundelian marbles were, it is said, converted into
rollers for bowling-greens. The fragments of others lie in
or beneath the foundations of the houses in Norfolk Street
and the streets adjacent.</p>

<p class='c029'>The Stafford-House portion of the collections—which
included pictures, drawings, vases, medals, and many miscellaneous
antiquities of great curiosity—was sold by auction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>in 1720. At the prices of that day the sale produced no
less a sum than £8852.</p>

<p class='c029'>The Arundelian cabinet of cameos and intaglios, now so
famous under the name of ‘The Marlborough Gems,’ was
offered to the Trustees of the British Museum for sale, at
an early period in the history of the institution. The price
asked by the then possessor, the Duchess Dowager of
<span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>, was £10,000. But at that time the funds of the
nascent institution were inadequate to the purchase.</p>

<p class='c035'>It affords conspicuous proof of the marvellous success which
had attended Lord <span class='sc'>Arundel’s</span> researches to find that the
remnants, so to speak, of his collections retain an almost
inestimable value, after so many losses and loppings. They
are virtually priceless, even if we leave out of view all that
is now private property.</p>

<p class='c029'>When the Arundelian MSS. were transferred, in the
years 1831 and 1832, to the British Museum, their money
value—for the purposes of the exchange as between the
Royal Society and the Museum Trustees—was estimated
(according to the historian of the Royal Society) at the
sum of £3559.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Weld, <i>History of the Royal Society</i>, vol. ii, pp. 448, 449.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This sum was given by the Trustees,
partly in money, and partly in printed books of which
the Museum possessed two or more than two copies. The
whole of the money received by the Royal Society was
expended by its Council in the purchase of other printed
books. So that both Libraries were benefited by the
exchange.</p>

<p class='c029'>It may deserve remark that a somewhat similar transfer
had been contemplated and discussed during the lifetime
of the original donor. The project, at that period, was to
make an exchange between the Royal Society and the
University of Oxford. The University induced <span class='sc'>Evelyn</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>to recommend Lord Henry <span class='sc'>Howard</span> to sanction an exchange
of such MSS. ‘as concern the civil law, theology,
and other scholastic learning, for mathematical, philosophical,
and such other books as may prove most useful to the
design and institution of the Society.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Evelyn to Howard; 14 March, 1669.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But at that time,
after much conference, it was otherwise determined.</p>

<p class='c029'>The heraldical and genealogical books belonging to the
original <span class='sc'>Arundel</span> Library were given, at the date of the
first transfer of the bulk of the collection to the Royal
Society, to the Heralds’ College. They still form an
important part of the College Library, and they include
valuable materials for the history of the family of
<span class='sc'>Howard</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Book I</span>, Chap. V. <span class='sc'>The Collector of the Harleian MSS.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Robert <span class='sc'>Harley</span> was the eldest son of Sir Edward <span class='sc'>Harley</span>,
of Brampton Bryan, in Herefordshire, by his second wife,
Abigail, daughter of Nathaniel <span class='sc'>Stephens</span>, of Essington, in
Gloucestershire. He was born at his father’s town-house
in Bow Street, Covent Garden, in the year 1661.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Harley Family.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The <span class='sc'>Harleys</span> had been a family of considerable note in
Herefordshire during several centuries. Many generations
of them had sat in the House of Commons, sometimes for
boroughs, but not infrequently for their county. Sir Edward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>sided with the Parliamentarians during the Civil Wars. He
was, however, one of those moderate statesmen who, in the
words of a once-celebrated clerical adherent and martyr of
their party, Christopher <span class='sc'>Love</span>, judged it ‘an ill way to cure
the body politic, by cutting off the political head.’ In due
time he also became one of those ‘secluded members’ of
the Long Parliament who published the ‘Remonstrance’ of
1656, and who were then as strenuous—though far less
successful—in opposing what they deemed to be the tyranny
of the Protector, as they had formerly been in opposing the
tyranny of the King. Sir Edward <span class='sc'>Harley</span> promoted the
restoration of <span class='sc'>Charles the Second</span>, and sat in all the Parliaments
of that reign. He distinguished himself as a
defender of liberty of conscience in unpropitious times;
and he won, in a high degree, the respect of men who sat
beside him in the House of Commons, but were rarely
counted with him upon a division.</p>

<p class='c029'>The first public act of Robert <span class='sc'>Harley</span> of which a record
has been kept is his appearance with his father, in 1688,
at the head of an armed band of tenantry and retainers,
assembled in Herefordshire to support the cause of the
Prince of <span class='sc'>Orange</span>, when the news had come of the Prince’s
arrival in Torbay.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Harley’s Parliamentary career.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>In the first Parliament of <span class='sc'>William</span> and <span class='sc'>Mary</span> Robert
<span class='sc'>Harley</span> sat for Tregony. To the second he was returned
by the burgesses of New Radnor. The first reported words
of his which appear in the debates were spoken in the
course of a discussion upon the heads of a ‘Bill of Indemnity.’
‘I think,’ said he on this occasion, ‘that the
King in his message has led us. He shews us how to proceed
for satisfaction of justice. There is a crime [of which]
God says, He will not pardon it.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Grey’s <i>Debates</i>, vol. ix, p. 247.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
’Tis the shedding of
innocent blood. A gentleman said that the West was “a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>shambles.” What made that shambles? It began in law.
It was a common discourse among the Ministers that “the
King cannot have justice.”’ The debate on the Bill of
Indemnity of 1690 may be looked upon as, in some sort,
the foreshadowing of a long spell of political conflict, in
which Robert <span class='sc'>Harley</span> was to take a conspicuous share.
Twenty seven years afterwards the strife of parties was to
enter on a new stage. Some of the men who acted as the
political Mentors of the new member of 1689–90 were to
live long enough to clamour for his execution as a traitor,
and, on their failure to produce any adequate proof that he
was guilty, were to console themselves by insisting on his
exclusion from the ‘Act of Grace’ of 1717.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='sc'>Harley</span> won his earliest distinctions in political life by
assiduous, patient, and even drudging labour on questions
of finance.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MS. Harl. 7524, f. 139, seqq.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
During six years, at least, he worked zealously
as one of the ‘Commissioners for stating the Public Accounts
of the Kingdom.’ In parliamentary debates on the
public establishments and expenditure he took a considerable
share. As a speaker he had no brilliancy. His usual
tone and manner, we are told, were somewhat listless and
drawling. But occasionally he would speak with a certain
pith and incisiveness.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Grey’s <i>Debates</i>, vol. x, p. 268.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Thus, in November, 1692, in a discussion
on naval affairs, he said—‘We have had a glorious
victory at sea. But although we have had the honour, the
enemy has had the profit. They take our merchant ships.’
Again, in the following year, when supporting the Bill for
more frequent Parliaments, he spoke thus:—‘A standing
Parliament can never be a true representative. Men are
much altered after they have been here some time. They
are no longer the same men that were sent up to us.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Of the truth of that saying, in one of its senses, <span class='sc'>Harley</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>became himself a salient instance. Bred a Whig, and
during his early years acting commonly with the Whigs,
his party ties were gradually relaxed. By temper and
mental constitution he was always inclined to moderate
measures. As the party waxed fiercer and fiercer, and as
its policy came to be more and more obviously the weapon
of its hatreds, <span class='sc'>Harley</span> soon lay open to the reproach of
being a trimmer. The growing breach became evident
enough in the course of the debates on the treason of Sir
John <span class='sc'>Fenwick</span>, in November, 1696.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>His Speech on the attainder of Fenwick.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He then argued,
with force and earnestness, that atrocity in a crime is no
justification or excuse for violence and unscrupulousness in
a prosecutor. Some of his applications of that sound
doctrine are very questionable. But it is to his honour
that he preached moderation with consistency. He did
not bend it to the exigencies of the party he was approaching,
any more than to those of the party from which he
was gradually withdrawing himself.</p>

<p class='c029'>Meanwhile he had signalised his powers in another way.
By long study he had acquired a considerable knowledge of
parliamentary law and precedent. He had taken his full
share in the work of committees. In February, 1701, he
was proposed for the Speakership, in opposition to Sir
Thomas <span class='sc'>Littleton</span>. He had a large body of supporters,
nor were they found exclusively in the Tory ranks. The
King sent for <span class='sc'>Littleton</span>, and told him that he thought it
would be for the public service that he should give way to
the choice of Mr. <span class='sc'>Harley</span> in his stead. But the election
was carried by a majority of only four votes. ‘It is a
great encouragement to his party,’ wrote <span class='sc'>Townshend</span> to
<span class='sc'>Walpole</span>, who was then in the country, ‘and no small
mortification to the Whigs.’ <span class='sc'>Harley</span> retained the Speakership
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>until the third session of the first Parliament of Queen
<span class='sc'>Anne</span>.</p>

<p class='c029'>Whatever may have been the ‘mortification of the Whigs’
at his elevation, it is certain that at this time <span class='sc'>Harley</span>
laboured zealously for the establishment of the Protestant
succession to the throne.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Harley and the Act of Succession.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1701. March.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In the preparation, facilitating,
and passing of that measure he took so influential a part
that, afterwards, he was able to say, in the face of his
opponents, when they were most numerous and most embittered,
‘I had the largest hand in settling the succession
of the House of Hanover.’ The assertion met with no
denial.</p>

<p class='c029'>It is evident, too, that the qualities for which he was
already reviled by extreme partisans on both sides were—in
their measure—real qualifications, both for the office of
Speaker and for the special task of that day. The party
leaders who were then most eagerly followed were men bent
on crushing their adversaries as well as conquering them. It
was inevitable that by such men <span class='sc'>Harley’s</span> moderation
towards opponents should be regarded as more cajolery.
And of that unhappy quality he was destined, at a later
day, to acquire but too much.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Secretaryship of State</span>, 1704.</div>

<p class='c029'>On the 27th of April, 1704, Mr. Speaker <span class='sc'>Harley</span> was
sworn of the Privy Council. On the 18th of May he received
the seals as one of the Principal Secretaries of State.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Privy Council Register</i>, Anne, vol. ii, p. 102.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He had scarcely entered on the duties of his office before
he was busied with precautionary measures in Scotland
against an anticipated Jacobite insurrection, as well as with
a large share of the foreign correspondence. But just at
that busy time he found means to begin—though he could
not then complete—an act of charity which is memorable
both on the recipient’s account and on the score of some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>well-known political consequences which eventually grew
thereout.</p>

<p class='c029'>At the time when <span class='sc'>Harley</span> became a member of the
<span class='sc'>Godolphin</span> administration Daniel <span class='sc'>De Foe</span> lay in Newgate,
under a conviction for seditious libel, committed in the
publication of his famous tract, <i>The Shortest Way with the
Dissenters</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Harley’s protection of De Foe</span>, 1704.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The new Secretary sent a confidential person
to the prison with instructions to visit <span class='sc'>De Foe</span>, and to ask
him, in the Minister’s name, ‘What can I do for you?’
<span class='sc'>De Foe’s</span> characteristic reply must be given in his own
words:—‘In return for this kind and generous message I
immediately took pen and ink, and writ the story of the
blind man in the Gospel,&#160;... to whom our blessed Lord put
the question, “What wilt thou that I should do unto thee?”
who—as if he had made it strange that such a question
should be asked, or as if he had said, “Lord, dost thou see
that I am blind, and yet ask me what thou shalt do for
me?”—my answer is plain in my misery, “Lord that I
may receive my sight.” I needed not to make the application.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>De Foe, <i>Appeal to Honour and Justice</i>, p. 11.</div>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>De Foe</span> then adds:—‘From this time, as I learned afterwards,
this noble person made it his business to have my
case represented to Her Majesty, and methods taken for
my deliverance.’ But the bigots who had caused a malicious
prosecution succeeded in delaying the successful issue
of the Secretary’s efforts during four months. With <span class='sc'>Harley</span>
the sufferer had had no previous acquaintance. The one
designation under which he ever afterwards spoke of him
was ‘my first benefactor.’ And the gratitude was lifelong.</p>

<p class='c029'>In part, <span class='sc'>Harley</span> owed his new office to the personal
credit which he had won with the Queen during his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Speakership; and in part, also, to the friendship of <span class='sc'>Marlborough</span>.
On receiving the news of his appointment the
Duke wrote to him, from the Camp:—‘I am sensible of the
advantage I shall reap by it, in having so good a friend
near Her Majesty’s person to present in the truest light my
faithful endeavours for her service.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Marlborough to Harley; 13 June, 1704.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But their intercourse,
if it ever attained to true cordiality at all, was cordial for
a very short time. Brief confidence was followed by long
distrust. <span class='sc'>Harley</span> strove to strengthen himself by the use of
channels of Court influence which were utterly inimical to
the <span class='sc'>Marlborough</span> connection. His efforts to make himself
independent of that connection did not, however, lessen
the prodigality of his assurances of friendship and fidelity.</p>

<p class='c029'>His political position thus became that of a man who was
exposed to the attacks of many bitter enemies among the
statesmen with whom he had begun his career, without
being able to rely upon any hearty support from those with
whom he now shared the conduct of affairs. He might
count, indeed, on assailants from the ranks both of the
extreme Whigs and the extreme Tories, whilst from most
of his own colleagues of the intermediate party he would
have to meet the greater danger of a lukewarm defence.
In such a position the attack was not likely to be long
waited for.</p>

<p class='c029'>Easiness of nature, and a tendency to alternate fits of
close application with fits of indolence, always characterised
him. And those qualities had an incidental consequence
which opened to his opponents a tempting opportunity.
<span class='sc'>Harley</span> was habitually less careful of official papers than
it behoved a Secretary of State to be.<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c030'><sup>[34]</sup></a> He was also at all
times prone to place a premature and undue confidence in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>his dependants. In 1707, William <span class='sc'>Gregg</span>, one of the
clerks in his office, abused his confidence by secretly copying
some letters of the highest importance and by selling the
copies to the Court of France.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Crime of William Gregg, and the use made of it by Harley’s enemies.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The treachery was discovered by the Secretary himself,
and such steps were taken to lessen the mischief as the case
admitted. Much excitement naturally followed upon the
publicity of the crime. The least scrupulous of <span class='sc'>Harley’s</span>
enemies conceived a hope that the traitor who had served
the public enemy for a bribe might also be tempted to ruin
his master for another and greater bribe. Means were
found to convey to <span class='sc'>Gregg</span> strong assurances of a certain
escape, and of a wealthy exile, if he would but declare that
he had copied the despatches, and forwarded the transcripts,
by the Secretary’s direction. Pending the attempt,
they circulated throughout the country a report that such
a declaration had actually been made, and that the Secretary
was to be impeached. But the clerk, instead of
betraying his master, exposed his temptors.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Appendix to Gregg’s Trial, &amp;c., in <i>State Trials</i>, vol. xii, pp. 694 seqq.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
His first
emphatic declaration of <span class='sc'>Harley’s</span> innocence was repeated
immediately before his death in these words:—‘As I shall
answer it before the judgment seat of Christ, the gentleman
aforesaid [<i>i. e.</i> <span class='sc'>Harley</span>] was not privy to my writing to
France, neither directly nor indirectly.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Harley</span> himself, and also his nearest friends, were wont
to speak of this affair as one that had brought his life into
real peril. It is certain that the incident and its consequences
helped materially to make his continuance in office
impossible. But he struggled hard.</p>

<p class='c029'>Meanwhile, the dissensions in the Ministry were daily
increasing.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Dismissed from Office.</span> Feb., 1708.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
They became so bitter as to lead to personal
altercations at the Council Board, even when the Queen
herself was present. On one such occasion (February,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>1708) <span class='sc'>Godolphin</span> and <span class='sc'>Marlborough</span> went together to the
Queen a little before the hour at which a Cabinet Council
had been summoned. They told her they must quit her
service, since they saw that she was resolved not to part
with <span class='sc'>Harley</span>. ‘She seemed,’ says Bishop <span class='sc'>Burnet</span>, ‘not
much concerned at the Lord <span class='sc'>Godolphin’s</span> offering to lay
down; and it was believed to be a part of <span class='sc'>Harley’s</span> new
scheme to remove him. But she was much touched with
the Duke of <span class='sc'>Marlborough’s</span> offering to quit, and studied,
with some soft expressions, to divert him from that resolution;
but he was firm; and she did not yield to them.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Burnet, <i>History of his own Time</i>, vol. v, pp. 343, 344 (edit. 1823).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
So they both went away, without attending the Council, ‘to
the wonder of the whole Court.’</p>

<p class='c029'>When the Council met, it became part of <span class='sc'>Harley’s</span> duty
as Secretary to deliver to the Queen a memorial relating to
the conduct of the war. The Duke of <span class='sc'>Somerset</span> rose, as
the Secretary was about to read it, and with the words
‘If Your Majesty suffers that fellow’ (pointing to <span class='sc'>Harley</span>)
‘to treat affairs of the war without the General’s advice, I
cannot serve you,’ abruptly left the Council.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Swift to Archbishop King, 12 Feb. 1708. Comp. Burnet, as above.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘The rest,’
according to <span class='sc'>Burnet</span>, ‘looked so cold and sullen that the
Cabinet Council was soon at an end.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Whilst a result which—for the time—had thus become
so plainly inevitable, remained still doubtful, <span class='sc'>Harley</span> had
imposed on himself the humiliating task of assuring the
Duke of <span class='sc'>Marlborough</span> of the honesty of his former professions
of attachment.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Harley’s dismissal from the Secretaryship.</span> Feb., 1708.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘I have never writ anything to
you,’ said he, ‘but what I really thought and intended.’
And then he went on to say:—‘I have for near two years
seen the storm coming upon me, and now I find I am to
be sacrificed to sly insinuations and groundless jealousies.’
These words were written in September, 1707. On the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>10th of February in the following year, <span class='sc'>Marlborough</span> had,
at length, the satisfaction of writing from St. James’ to a
foreign correspondent:—‘Mr. Secretary <span class='sc'>Harley</span> has this
afternoon given up the seals of office to the Queen. Between
ourselves he richly deserves what has befallen him.’<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c030'><sup>[35]</sup></a>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Marlborough to Count Wratislaw, 10 Feb., 1708.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Among
the two or three friends who went out with <span class='sc'>Harley</span> was
Henry <span class='sc'>St. John</span>.</p>

<p class='c029'>For the next two years and a half, <span class='sc'>Harley’s</span> principal
occupation was to prepare the way for a return, in kind, of
the defeat thus inflicted upon him.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The intrigue against the Godolphin Ministry.</span> 1708–1710.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Some of the steps by
which he achieved his end are among the most familiar
portions of our political history. But from the necessities
of the case it has been, and probably it must continue to
be, one of those portions in which the basis of truth can
scarcely, by any researches that are now possible, be separated
from the large admixture of falsehood built thereon
by party animosities.</p>

<p class='c029'>His own correspondence shows that strong hopes of
success in the effort were entertained within eight months
of his dismissal. It shows also that the channel employed,
unsuccessfully, in 1708, was that which became an effectual
one in 1710.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>Early in October, <span class='sc'>Harley</span> received from the Court an
unsigned letter in which these passages occur:—‘The Queen
stands her ground and refuses to enter into any capitulation
with the [Whig Lords]. She has not hitherto consented
to offer or hear of any terms. The Lord T[reasure]r
desired she might allow him to treat with ’em, and the
Duke of <span class='sc'>S[omerse]t</span> was employed to persuade her, but
she was inflexible. The Lord Treasurer offered to resign
the Staff, but she would neither take the Staff nor advice
from him, and he went to Newmarket without getting any
powers or leave to treat....

<p class='c029'>It was not, however, until the 8th of August, 1710, that
the <span class='sc'>Godolphin</span> Ministry was dismissed. Two days afterwards,
<span class='sc'>Harley</span> was made Chancellor of the Exchequer;
the Treasury being put into commission.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Chancellorship of the Exchequer.</span> 1710, August.</div>

<p class='c029'>He entered upon that office amidst enormous obstacles.
His enemies were unable to deny that his exertions to overcome
the difficulties in his path were marked by financial
ability, and by a large measure of temporary success. But
as little can it be denied that the immediate triumph laid
the groundwork of public troubles to come.</p>

<p class='c029'>His own account of the situation of affairs, and of the
methods taken to improve it, must, of course, be read with
the due allowance. The pith of it lies in these sentences:—‘The
army was in the field. There was no money in
the Treasury. None of the remitters would contract again.
The Bank had recently refused to lend the Lord Treasurer
<span class='sc'>Godolphin</span> a hundred thousand pounds. The Army and
Navy Services were in debt nearly eleven millions. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Civil List owed £600,000. The annual deficit was, at
least, a hundred and twenty-four thousand pounds. The
new Commissioners of the Treasury, nevertheless, made
provision, within a few days of their appointment, for paying
the Army by the greatest remittance that was ever
known.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Letter to the Queen</i>, June 9, 1714. (<i>Parl. Hist.</i>, vol. vii, App.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When Parliament met, on the 27th of November,
funds had been prepared for the service of the year, and a
plan was submitted for easing the nation of nine millions of
debt.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Harley</span> was scarcely warm in his new office before he
made the acquaintance of <span class='sc'>Swift</span>, then full of ambitious
though vague schemes for the future, and very angry with
the leaders of the Whig party for the coolness with which
his proffers, both of counsel and of service, had lately been
received.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Early intercourse with Swift.</span> 1710–1711.</div>

<p class='c029'>At the time of his introduction to <span class='sc'>Harley</span>, <span class='sc'>Swift’s</span>
immediate business in London consisted in soliciting from
the Government a remission of first-fruits to the clergy of
Ireland. His nominal colleagues in that trust were the
Bishops of Ossory and Killaloe, but the whole weight of
the negotiations rested upon <span class='sc'>Swift’s</span> shoulders. His treatment
of it soon displayed his parts. The Minister saw
that he was both able and willing to render efficient political
service. To the intercourse so begun we owe a life-like
portraiture of <span class='sc'>Harley</span>, under all his aspects, and in every
mood of mind. Nor is the depicter himself anywhere seen
under stronger light than in those passages of his journal
which narrate, from day to day, the rise and fall of the
Government founded on the unstable alliance between
<span class='sc'>Harley</span> and <span class='sc'>St. John</span>.</p>

<p class='c029'>Of their first interview <span class='sc'>Swift</span> notes:—‘I was brought
privately to Mr. <span class='sc'>Harley</span>, who received me with the greatest
respect and kindness imaginable.’ Of the second:—‘We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>were two hours alone.... He read a memorial I had drawn
up, and put it into his pocket to show the Queen; told me
the measures he would take,&#160;... told me he must bring
Mr. <span class='sc'>St. John</span> and me acquainted; and spoke so many things
of personal kindness and esteem for me, that I am inclined
half to believe what some friends have told me, that he
would do everything to bring me over.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Journal to Stella</i>; in Works, 2nd Edit., vol. ii, pp. 33; 37; 80.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When the promised
interview with Secretary <span class='sc'>St. John</span> comes to be diarized in
its turn:—‘He told me,’ says <span class='sc'>Swift</span>, ‘among other things,
that Mr. <span class='sc'>Harley</span> complained he could keep nothing from
me, I had the way so much of getting into him.’ I knew
that was a refinement.... It is hard to see these great
men using me like one who was their betters, and the
puppies with you in Ireland hardly regarding me.’ Not
many weeks had passed before <span class='sc'>Swift’s</span> pen was at work in
defence of the measures of the Government with an energy,
a practical and versatile ability, of which, up to that date,
there had been scarcely an example, brilliant as was the
roll of contemporary writers who had taken sides in the
political strife. <span class='sc'>Swift’s</span> defects, as well as his merits,
armed him for his task.</p>

<p class='c029'>Nor had he been long engaged upon it before he marked,
very distinctly, the character both of the rewards to which
he aspired, and of the personal independence which he was
determined to maintain, in his own fashion.</p>

<p class='c029'>One day, as he took his leave of <span class='sc'>Harley</span>, after dining
with him, the Minister placed in his hand a fifty pound
note. He returned it angrily. And he met <span class='sc'>Harley’s</span>
next invitation by a refusal. Then comes this entry in his
diary:—‘I was this morning early with Mr. <span class='sc'>Lewis</span>, of the
Secretary’s office, and saw a letter Mr. <span class='sc'>Harley</span> had sent
to him desiring to be reconciled; but I was deaf to all
entreaties, and have desired <span class='sc'>Lewis</span> to go to him and let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>him know I expect further satisfaction. If we let these
great Ministers pretend too much there will be no governing
them. He promises to make me easy if I will but
come and see him. But I will not, and he shall do it by
message, or I will cast him off.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Journal to Stella</i>, p. 169.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The desired concession
was made, and in a day or two we find our journalist recording,
characteristically enough, that he ‘sent Mr. <span class='sc'>Harley</span>
into the House to call the Secretary [<span class='sc'>St. John</span>], to let
him know I would not dine with him if he dined late.’
And then:—‘I have taken Mr. <span class='sc'>Harley</span> into favour again....
I will cease to visit him after dinner, for he dines too
late for my head....
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ib.</i>, pp. 178; 182.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
They call me nothing but
“Jonathan,” and I said I believed they would leave me
Jonathan as they found me, and that I never knew a
Ministry do anything for those whom they make companions
of their pleasures.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Swift</span> was one of the first bystanders who took note of the
seeds of dissension which were already growing up between
<span class='sc'>Harley</span> and <span class='sc'>St. John</span>, and who foresaw the coming parallel
between the fate of the new Government and that of its
predecessor. On the 4th of March, 1711, he wrote:—‘We
must have a Peace, let it be a bad or a good one;
though nobody dares talk of it. The nearer I look upon
things the worse I like them. I believe the Confederacy
will soon break to pieces, and our factions at home increase.
The Ministry is upon a very narrow bottom, and stands
like an isthmus between the Whigs on one side, and the
violent Tories on the other. They are able seamen, but
the tempest is too great, the ship too rotten, and the crew
all against them....
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ib.</i>, p. 196.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Your Duchess of <span class='sc'>Somerset</span>, who
now has the key, is a most insinuating woman, and I believe
they [the Whigs] will endeavour to play the same
game that has been played against them.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>The game was suddenly interrupted, though only for a
while. An attempt to assassinate <span class='sc'>Harley</span> gave him a
renewed hold upon power and popularity. But its unexpected
consequences embittered the jealousies which already
menaced his administration with ruin.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Guiscard’s attempt on the life of Harley.</span> 1711, March.</div>

<p class='c029'>Antoine de <span class='sc'>Guiscard</span> was a French adventurer, whose private
life had been marked by great profligacy. He had taken
an obscure part in the insurrection of the Cevennes—rather
as a recruiting agent than as a combatant. In that character
he had met with encouragement to raise a refugee
regiment in England. Hopes had also been held out to
him that a British auxiliary contingent would be landed on
the southern coast of France. In the course, however, of
some preliminary inquiries into the position of the insurrectionists,
it was found that such an invasion would have
little chance of any useful result, and the project was
abandoned. Meanwhile, a pension of £400 a year had
been bestowed on the emissary.</p>

<p class='c029'>But ere long it was discovered that <span class='sc'>Guiscard</span> had
profited by opportunities, afforded him in the course of the
discussions about the proposed expedition, to make himself
conversant with many particulars of military and naval
affairs, and that it was his habit to send advices into
France. Some of his letters were seized. Their writer
was arrested on the 8th of March, 1711, and was taken,
immediately, before a Committee of the Privy Council.</p>

<p class='c029'>When examined as to his illicit intercourse with France
he persisted in mere denials. At length, one of his letters
was shown to him by <span class='sc'>Harley</span>, and he was closely pressed
as to his motives in writing it. He then addressed himself
to Secretary <span class='sc'>St. John</span>, and begged permission to speak with
him apart. The Secretary answered, ‘You are here before
the Council as a criminal. Whatever you may have to say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>must be said to all of us.’ The man persisted in refusing
to reply to any further questions, unless his request was
granted. Seeing that nothing more could then be obtained
from him, the Lord President rose to ring the bell for a
messenger, that the prisoner might be removed in
custody.</p>

<p class='c029'>At that moment the prisoner pulled a penknife from his
pocket, turned towards <span class='sc'>Harley</span>, near to whom he stood,
and stabbed him in the breast. He repeated the stroke,
and then rushed towards <span class='sc'>St. John</span>. But between the
prisoner and the Secretary there stood a small table, over
which he stumbled. <span class='sc'>St. John</span> drew his sword, and, with
the words ‘The villain has killed Mr. <span class='sc'>Harley</span>,’ struck at
him, as did also the Duke of <span class='sc'>Ormond</span> and the Duke of
<span class='sc'>Newcastle</span>. Lord <span class='sc'>Powlett</span> cried out ‘Do not kill him.’
Presently the assassin was in the hands of several messengers,
with whom, notwithstanding his wounds, he struggled
so desperately that more than one of them received severe
injuries. When at length overpowered, he said to <span class='sc'>Ormond</span>,
‘My Lord, why do you not despatch me?’ ‘That,’ replied
the Duke, ‘is not the work of gentlemen. ’Tis another
man’s business.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Harley’s</span> wound was so severe that for several days there
was a belief that it would prove mortal. It entailed a lingering
illness.<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c030'><sup>[36]</sup></a> Before his recovery, his assailant died in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>prison. The coroner’s inquest ascribed <span class='sc'>Guiscard’s</span> death
to bruises received from one of the messengers who strove
to bind him, but <span class='sc'>Swift</span> tells us that he died of the sword-wounds.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Journal to Stella</i>, pp. 202–214.</div>

<p class='c029'>That keen observer had seen, long before this attempted
assassination, the latent personal jealousies between <span class='sc'>Harley</span>
and <span class='sc'>St. John</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Harley becomes Lord High Treasurer.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He had recognised in those jealousies the
gravest peril of <span class='sc'>Harley’s</span> government. <span class='sc'>Guiscard’s</span> crime
had now made <span class='sc'>Harley</span> the most popular man in the
country, and it had doubled his favour with the Queen.
On his recovery, he received the congratulations of the
House of Commons, expressed with more than usual
emphasis.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Journals of

By the Queen he was raised to the peerage
(24 May, 1711) as Earl of <span class='sc'>Oxford</span> and Earl <span class='sc'>Mortimer</span>.
Five days afterwards (29 May) he was made Lord High
Treasurer.

His elevation intensified the jealousy of <span class='sc'>St.
John</span> into something which already closely resembled hatred,
although years were to elapse before the mask could be quite
thrown aside. It is amusing to read the philosophical
reflection with which the Secretary sent the news to Lord
<span class='sc'>Ossory</span>:—‘Our friend Mr. <span class='sc'>Harley</span> is now Earl of <span class='sc'>Oxford</span>
and High Treasurer. This great advancement is what the
labour he has gone through, the danger he has run, and
the services he has performed, seem to deserve.

Lord Ossory;
1711, 12 June
(<i>Corresp.</i> i,

But he
stands on slippery ground, and envy is always near the great
to fling up their heels on the least trip which they
make.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The Earl of <span class='sc'>Oxford</span> had not long obtained the Treasurer’s
staff before he received some characteristic exhortations
from the Jacobite section of his Tory supporters of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>use which he ought to make of it. <span class='sc'>Atterbury</span> came to
him, on the part of some of the Treasurer’s ‘particular
friends,’ to acquaint him how uneasy they were that he had
neither dissolved the Parliament, nor removed from office
nearly so many Whigs as those particular friends wished to
see removed. ‘I know very well,’ replied the Earl, ‘the men
from whom that message comes, and I am also very sensible
of the difficulties I have to struggle with. If, in addition,
I must communicate all my measures, it will be necessary
for me to assure Her Majesty that I can no longer do her
any service.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Oxford and the October Club.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>These hot-headed politicians had already formed their
famous ‘October Club.’ They were about a hundred and
fifty in number, and for a few months their proceedings
made a great noise. The Treasurer found means to deal
with them in a more effectual fashion than that in which
they had endeavoured to deal with the administration. ‘By
silent, quiet steps, in a little time,’ says a writer who
watched the process and aided it, ‘he so effectually separated
these gentlemen, that in less than six months the
name of “October Club” was forgotten in the world....
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>De Foe, <i>Secret History of the White Staff</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
With so much address was this attempt overthrown, that
he lost not the men, though he put them by their
design.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Those brief sentences indicate, I think, the fatality of the
position in which <span class='sc'>Oxford</span> now placed himself. He had
ardently desired to gain the control of affairs, at a period
of exceptional difficulty. And, at the best, his capacity
and energies would have been barely equal to the task in
times of exceptional ease. Some of the very qualities, both
of mind and heart, which made him beloved by those who
lived with him, weakened him as a statesman. He was
surrounded by adepts in political intrigue, some of whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>combined with an experience not less than his own, far
greater powers of mind, an unbending will, and an utter
unscrupulousness as to the use of means. He vainly flattered
himself that he could beat these men at their own
weapons. His temporary success laid a foundation for
his eventual ruin.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Oxford and the Court of the Stuarts.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>To gain the aid of the Jacobite Tories in Parliament he
held out hopes which it was never his intention to realise.
He carried on an indirect correspondence with the Stuart
Court in a way sufficiently adroit to induce that Court to
instruct its adherents to support the negotiations for the
Peace with France. He would commit himself to nothing
until Peace was made. The conclusion of a Peace was the
one measure on which he was firmly bent. He had contended
that the true interests of Britain demanded the ending
of an exhausting war many years before. And whatever
the demerits and shortcomings of the Treaty of Utrecht,
it had at least the merit of making the quiet succession
of the House of Hanover possible.</p>

<p class='c029'>In March, 1713, the French agent in England, the Abbé
<span class='sc'>Gautier</span>, wrote to the Marquis de <span class='sc'>Torcy</span> an account of an
interview he had obtained with the Lord Treasurer:—‘M.
Vanderberg’ [<i>i. e.</i> Lord <span class='sc'>Oxford</span>], he says, ‘sent for me,
seven or eight days ago, to tell me something of importance.
Indeed, he opened his mind to me, making me acquainted
with his feelings towards Montgourlin [<i>i. e.</i> the Pretender],
and the desire he had to do him service, as soon as the
Peace shall be concluded....  It will not be difficult,
because the Queen is of his opinion. But, in the mean
time, it is essential that Montgourlin should make up his
mind; that he should declare that it is not his intention
to continue to reside where he now is. He must say, publicly,
and especially before his family, that when the Peace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>is made he means to travel in Italy, in Switzerland, in
Bavaria, even in Spain.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Gautier to De Torcy; 1713, March. [Printed in <i>Edin. Review</i>, from notes of Mackintosh.]<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This is to be done, that it may be
believed in England that his choice of a residence is not
dictated by a mere desire to be near his relatives, and to
be close at hand should measures have to be taken on an
emergency.’</p>

<p class='c029'>After the communication of this statement to the Pretender
he made repeated attempts to enter into correspondence
with Queen <span class='sc'>Anne</span>. By <span class='sc'>Oxford</span> these attempts
were uniformly and effectually foiled.</p>

<p class='c029'>To the insincerity of <span class='sc'>Oxford’s</span> advances—such as they
were—to the Jacobite emissaries, there can be no witness
more competent, none more unexceptionable, than the Duke
of <span class='sc'>Berwick</span>. His testimony runs thus:—‘We wrote,’ he
says, ‘to all the Jacobites to support the government; a step
which had no small share in giving to the Court party so
large a majority in the House of Commons that it carried
everything its own way.... After the Peace, the Treasurer
spoke with not a whit more of clearness or precision than
before it....
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Mémoires du Maréchal Duc de Berwick</i> (in Petitot’s <i>Collection</i>, tom. lxvi, pp. 219 seqq.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He was merely keeping us in play; and it
was very difficult to find a remedy. To have broken with
him would have spoiled all; for he had the reins in his
hand. He governed the Queen at his will.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ib.</i>, pp. 224, 225.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In all his
advances, adds the Duke, in another passage, ‘<span class='sc'>Oxford’s</span>
only motive had been to win over Jacobites to side with
the Tories, and to get a sanction for the Peace.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Whilst these intrigues were still in action, one, at least,
of the Jacobite agents was clear-sighted enough to detect
the secret of the Treasurer’s scheme.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Original in Nairne MSS., vol. 4. (Macpherson, <i>Original Pagers</i>, vol. ii, p. 269.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
A confidential agent
of the Earl of <span class='sc'>Middleton</span>, Secretary to the Pretender,
wrote in February, 1712—‘[The Earl of <span class='sc'>Oxford</span>] is
entirely a friend to [the Elector of <span class='sc'>Hanover</span>], notwithstanding
the disobliging measures that spark has taken....
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>[<span class='sc'>Oxford’s</span>] head is set on shewing that he is above
resentment, and that he [the Elector] has been put into a
wrong way.’</p>

<p class='c029'>In matters of Church policy at home the Earl followed
like indirect courses, and with the like result—a momentary
success which prepared the way for final defeat.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Harley’s conduct on the Conformity Bill.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>No measure could possibly be more repugnant to <span class='sc'>Oxford’s</span>
declared convictions than the famous ‘Bill against
Occasional Conformity,’ brought into the House of Lords
by the Earl of <span class='sc'>Nottingham</span>, at the close of the year 1711.
It was part of a policy to which his very nature was antagonistic.
But he was in vain entreated, by men who had
been his life-long adherents, to oppose it. The passage of
that Bill was the price, and, as it seems, the only price for
which <span class='sc'>Nottingham</span> and his band of followers would give
their support to the foreign policy of the Government.</p>

<p class='c029'>The growth of the internal dissensions in the administration
kept pace with the growth of its external perils. Personal
objects of the pettiest kind were made occasions of quarrel.
In the summer of 1712, <span class='sc'>St. John</span>, who had set his heart
on the restoration in himself of that family Earldom of
<span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span> which in the previous year had become extinct
on the death of a distant relative, was made a Viscount.
On the announcement of his creation he burst into open
menaces of vengeance against the Treasurer, and renewed
them with greater violence towards the close of the year,
when he found himself excluded from another coveted
dignity. An election of Knights of the Garter made, to
use Lord <span class='sc'>Oxford’s</span> own words about it, ‘a new disturbance
which is too well remembered.’ Just as the breach with
<span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span> had become plainly irreconcilable, the Treasurer
found a new and equally bitter enemy in another old
friend. He defeated a rapacious attempt made by Lady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span><span class='sc'>Masham</span> on the Treasury. The first offence in that kind
would never have been forgiven. But ere long it was
repeated.</p>

<p class='c029'>In both Houses of Parliament, <span class='sc'>Oxford’s</span> veiled and
vacillating policy was fast alienating men who had long
supported him, and who to the last retained more confidence
in him than in his brilliant rival. The crisis, however,
was brought about, not by the increased strength of
Parliamentary opposition, but by bed-chamber intrigues,
such as those which he had himself stooped to employ six
years before against <span class='sc'>Godolphin</span> and <span class='sc'>Marlborough</span>.</p>

<p class='c029'>Meanwhile the Minister played into the hands of his
opponents by exhibiting great irresolution. He dallied and
procrastinated with urgent business. He relaxed in his
attention to the Queen. At an unwary moment he even
gave her personal offence, the results of which were none
the less bitter for the absence of design. He showed more
concern about comparatively distant perils than about those
which were close at hand.</p>

<p class='c029'>At the beginning of 1714 the best informed of the
Jacobites had become fully convinced that <span class='sc'>Oxford</span> was
their enemy. They saw, to repeat the words of the Duke
of <span class='sc'>Berwick</span>, that he had been only keeping them in play.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Oxford’s correspondence with the Court of Hanover.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But at the Court of Hanover he was far from being regarded
as an assured friend. Over-subtlety had been rewarded
with almost universal distrust.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1714, April.</div>

<p class='c029'>When in April of that year he sent to Hanover renewed
protestations of fidelity, expressed in terms of unusual
energy, they were looked upon by some of the Elector’s
advisers as mere professions.<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c030'><sup>[37]</sup></a> If now read side by side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>with contemporary documents, drawn up by secret emissaries
of the Pretender, they acquire a stamp of sincerity
which it is hard to doubt.</p>

<p class='c029'>To Baron <span class='sc'>Wassenaer Duyvenworde</span> Lord <span class='sc'>Oxford</span>
wrote thus:—‘I do in the most solemn manner assure you
that, next to the Queen, I am entirely and unalterably
devoted to the interests of His Electoral Highness of
Hanover.... I am ready to give him all the proofs
of my attachment to his interest, and to set in a true light
the state of this country; for it will be very unfortunate for
so great a Prince to be only Prince over a party, which
can never last long in England.’ He then goes on to add
that the one thing which would, under existing circumstances,
imperil the Hanover succession is the sending
into England of any member of that family without the
Queen’s consent. Such an act would, in his judgment,
‘change the dispute to the Crown and the Successor,
whereas now it is between the House of Hanover and the
Popish Pretender.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Oxford to Wassenaer; MS. Sloane, 4107. (B. M.)</div>

<p class='c029'>He repeated the advice in another and not less urgent
letter, after the occurrence of the visit made to the Lord
Chancellor <span class='sc'>Harcourt</span> by the Hanoverian Resident, to ask
for a writ of summons for the Duke of <span class='sc'>Cambridge</span>. But
he also advised Queen <span class='sc'>Anne</span> to consent to the issue of such
a writ. He was opposed by a majority of his colleagues,
under the leadership of <span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span>, as well as by the
persistent unwillingness of the Queen herself.</p>

<p class='c029'>It is instructive to read the comments on the political
situation in England at this moment, of a German diplomatist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>resident in London (as Minister from the Elector
Palatine) who was devotedly attached to the Hanoverian
succession.</p>

<p class='c029'>‘Some people,’ wrote Baron von <span class='sc'>Steinghengs</span> to Count
von der <span class='sc'>Schulenberg</span>, on the 12th of May, ‘have been at
work for a whole year to deprive the Lord Treasurer of the
conduct of public affairs. I have been aware, almost from
the beginning, of the different channels which have been
made use of to carry this point. But I should never have
expected that they would fire the mine before the end of
this session, and I am much mistaken if the authors have
not reason one day to regret their over-haste. For I do
not know my man, if he does not cut out a good deal of
work for them, particularly if a certain intrigue which is on
the tapis succeeds. As for the rest, you may rely upon his
sentiments; and he never succeeded in persuading those
who doubted them more than by his declaration made in a
full House on the 16th of last month on the question of
danger to the Protestant succession, having in it given
much greater hold upon himself than there was any need
for, if he was not acting in good faith.... The party of
the Hanoverian Tories has visibly been strengthened by it.’

And to this the writer adds, in a postscript, ‘It is of
extreme importance both for the Whigs and for the
House of Hanover to take steps to keep him there, and to
engage him by some sort of political confidence to be
assured of his fortunes under that House.’ In another
letter to the same correspondent, Baron von <span class='sc'>Steinghengs</span>
notes a fact which by many of our historians has been too
much neglected.

in the way of making the Peace such as it might have

<p class='c029'>But although ‘the mine was fired’ before the end of

<span class='sc'>Bolingbroke’s</span> triumph lasted exactly four days.
‘The Earl of <span class='sc'>Oxford</span> was removed on Tuesday. The
Queen died on Sunday. What a world is this! And
how does Fortune banter us!... I have lost all by the
death of the Queen, but my spirit.’ Such were the words
in which <span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span> announced to <span class='sc'>Swift</span> his victory,—and
its futility. In a few more days the spirit vanished,
like the triumph. The victor was a fugitive.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Bolingbroke’s</span> hatred to <span class='sc'>Oxford</span> lasted to the close of
his life. He survived his old comrade twenty-seven years.
The final year of that long period brought no relenting
thought, no spark of charitable feeling.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Did Oxford conspire to bring back the Pretender?</span></div>

<p class='c029'>To the question ‘Did Lord <span class='sc'>Oxford</span>, during his tenure of
office, conspire to enthrone the Pretender?’ it ought always
to have been a sufficient answer that there was, as yet, not a
tittle of <i>evidence</i> of any such conspiracy on his part. That
accusation had never any support beyond surmise and
conjecture. Men who were in possession of every imaginable
resource and appliance to back their search failed to
adduce even a shadow of evidence in proof of the charge
they would fain have fastened upon him. And in 1869
the matter still stands, in the main, where it stood in
1717.</p>

<p class='c029'>After many examinations of the most secret correspondence
of the Stuarts and their adherents, and after the
publishing of extensive selections from it—made at intervals
which spread over eighty years,—not a scrap of direct and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>valid testimony has been found to sustain the charge. Every
passage, save one, which bears at all on <span class='sc'>Oxford’s</span> intercourse
with Jacobite emissaries, up to the year 1715, tends to show
that what they asserted about his intentions on the Pretender’s
behalf was built on wishes, hopes, and guesses—on
anything rather than knowledge. Every passage, save one,
tends to show that he was using the Jacobites for his own
purposes, without the least idea of aiding theirs. Every
passage, save one, is in entire harmony with the terms of
that incompatible charge by means of which <span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span>
justified to himself his life-long hostility, when writing the
<i>Letter to Sir William Wyndham</i>. The significance of that
charge, coming from such a source, can scarcely be exaggerated.
‘<span class='sc'>Oxford</span> would not,’ wrote <span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span>, ‘or
he could not, act with us, and he resolved that we should
not act without him, as long as he could hinder it....
At the Queen’s death, he hoped&#160;... to deliver us up,
bound as it were, hand and foot, to our adversaries. On
the foundation of this merit he flattered himself that he had
gained some of the Whigs, and softened, at least, the rest
of the party to him.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Bolingbroke, <i>Letter to Sir W. Wyndham</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
By his secret negotiations at Hanover,
he took it for granted that he was not only reconciled to
that Court, but that he should, under his present Majesty’s
reign, have as much credit as he had enjoyed under that of
the Queen.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gautier to De Torcy; 14 December, 1713. [Printed in <i>Edinb. Review</i>, from the Notes of Sir James Mackintosh, in vol. lxii, pp. 18, seqq.]</div>

<p class='c029'>The solitary passage in the correspondence of the Jacobite
agents which goes directly to the issue is the assertion made
by <span class='sc'>Gautier</span>, in a letter to <span class='sc'>De Torcy</span>, that <span class='sc'>Oxford</span> said to
him, in December, 1713, ‘As long as I live, England shall
not be governed by a German.’ In that notable statement
lies the pith of a mass of letters which report the hopes,
beliefs, conjectures, and imaginings, of their respective
writers, as to what Lord <span class='sc'>Oxford</span> would do for the Pretender,—whenever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>that prince could be brought to change,
or, at least, to disguise his religion.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='sc'>Oxford</span> was present, as a Privy Councillor, at the proclamation
of King <span class='sc'>George the First</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Oxford’s reception by George I.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It was noted by some
of the bystanders that his demeanour was buoyant and
joyous. When the King reached Greenwich, the Earl
went thither with more than usual pomp and retinue. He
was received with marked coldness, if not with open
contempt.</p>

<p class='c029'>There is little need, in a sketch of this kind, to tell, at
length, the story of an impeachment which was stretched
over two years, and had no result save that of breaking
down, by two years of imprisonment, the health of the
defeated statesman. Few and brief words on that head
will suffice.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>His Impeachment.</span> 1715–1717.</div>

<p class='c029'>Out of twenty-two articles of impeachment, fourteen
accuse the Earl of <span class='sc'>Oxford</span> of betrayal of duty, either in
the conduct of the negotiations for Peace, or in instructions
given for handling the British Army—pending those negotiations—in
such a way as to injure the common cause of
the Allies, by promoting the conclusion of a treaty ‘on
terms fatal to the interests of the Kingdom.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1715. June 24.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The fifteenth
article charges him with inserting false statements in the
Queen’s Speeches and Messages to Parliament; the sixteenth
with improperly advising the Queen to make a
creation of Peers.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>State Trials</i>, vol. xv, Coll. 1052, seqq.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Other articles allege misconduct in the
management of an expedition to Canada; the appropriation
of sums of ‘Secret Service Money’ to corrupt purposes;
and treasonable intercourse with ‘Irish Papists.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Whilst these charges were still in preparation the
Venetian Resident in London wrote a despatch to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>Senate in which we have an interesting glimpse, behind
the curtain, at the process:—‘The Whigs,’ he says, ‘seek
to annihilate the Tories utterly, and to place them under
the yoke. They want to impeach even the Duke of <span class='sc'>Shrewsbury</span>.’...
After enlarging on nascent dissensions
amongst the Whigs themselves, as to the lengths to which
they might safely carry their party resentments, he proceeds
to assert that the more cautious men among them ‘have
now, when it is well nigh too late, become aware that the
Tory party, recently dominant, was a mixed party.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Correspondence of Joseph Querini</i>; from extracts by T. D. Hardy, in <i>Report on Archives of Venice</i>, pp. 98, 99.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Some
were in favour of the Pretender; some for the House of
Hanover. Had His Majesty made this distinction on
his accession to the Crown he would have excluded the
former, but not the latter. By favouring the Whigs
alone, he lost all the others at once.’ In brief, <span class='sc'>George
the First</span> had made himself exactly what <span class='sc'>Oxford</span>
had warned him against becoming, the ‘King of a party.’</p>

<p class='c029'>When the Earl at length appeared before his peers to
answer to his impeachment, he began by denying ‘that at
any time or place in the course of those negotiations,’ now
incriminated, ‘he conferred unlawfully or without due
authority with any emissaries of France.’ He affirmed
that he neither promoted nor advised any private, separate,
or unjustifiable negotiation, and that he himself had no
knowledge ‘that any negotiation relating to Peace was
carried on without communication to the Allies.’</p>

<p class='c029'>On the specific charge that he had traitorously given up
Tournay to France, his defence is twofold:—‘I used my
best offices,’ he asserts, ‘to preserve that town and fortress
to the States General. I believe that at this time they are
continued to the States General as part of their barrier.’
And then he adds:—‘But I deny that for a Privy Councillor
and Minister of State to advise the yielding of any town,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>fort, or territory, upon the conclusion of a Peace, is, or
can be, High Treason by any law of this realm.’</p>

<p class='c029'>On the whole matter of the Peace, he asserts that ‘its
terms and preliminaries were communicated to Parliament.
They were agreed on with the concurrence of Parliament.
The Definitive Treaty was afterwards approved of by both
Houses. Solemn thanks were rendered to God for it in
all our churches and also in the churches of the United
Provinces. Her Majesty received upon its conclusion the
hearty and unfeigned thanks of her people from all parts of
her dominions.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Commons’ Journals</i>, 9 June, 1715.</div>

<p class='c029'>It might well have been thought that even in those evil
days it would be difficult to induce a Committee of partisans
to report to the House of Commons that ‘large sums
issued for the service of the war were received by the Earl
of <span class='sc'>Oxford</span>, and applied to his Lordship’s private use,’
without the possession of some plausible show of proof.
There was not so much as a decent presumption, or colourable
inference, to back the assertion. When the matter
came to be probed, it appeared that a royal gift of £13,000
had been received by the Earl in what were known as ‘tin
tallies,’ and that the sum had been a charge upon the
revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall.</p>

<p class='c035'>Probably few politicians have owed quite so large a debt
of gratitude to their enemies as that incurred by the Earl of
<span class='sc'>Oxford</span>. His ministry at home had been marked by weaknesses
which went perilously near the edge of public calamity.
The Peace which was its characteristic achievement
abroad had brought with it many real blessings, but they
were won at the cost of a large sacrifice of national pride,
if not also by some sacrifice of national honour. The wild
excesses of his adversaries now gave back to the obnoxious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Minister the strength of his best days.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Oxford’s behaviour under trial.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When <span class='sc'>Pope</span> wrote
of him, ‘The utmost weight of ministerial power and popular
hatred were almost worth bearing for the glory of so
dauntless a conduct as he has shown under it,’ the praise
came from a pen which is known to have been employed,
now and again, to flatter the great. But it was no flatterer
who wrote to <span class='sc'>Oxford</span> himself—‘Your intrepid behaviour
under this prosecution astonishes every one but me, who
know you so well, and how little it is in the power of
human actions or events to discompose you. I have seen
your Lordship labouring under great difficulties and exposed
to great dangers, and overcoming both, by the providence
of God, and your own wisdom and courage.’ Those
words came from one of the shrewdest and most acute
observers of human character that have ever lived. They
were written after a close and daily intimacy of four eventful
years. <span class='sc'>Oxford</span>, in his day of power, had disappointed
<span class='sc'>Swift</span> of some cherished hopes, which now could never be
renewed. The praise of <span class='sc'>Swift</span> must have been sincere.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Swift’s <i>Correspondence</i>, in Works, by Scott, vol. xvi, pp. 232, 233.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When such a writer, at such a time, goes on to add—‘You
suffer for having preserved your country, and for having
been the great instrument, under God, of his present
Majesty’s peaceable accession to the throne;—this I know,
and this your enemies know’—the most prepossessed reader
cannot but feel that the absence from the two and twenty
articles of impeachment of any charge of plotting against
the Hanover succession is alike intelligible and significant.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Trial.</span> 1717, July.</div>

<p class='c029'>When Oxford’s imprisonment could be no longer protracted
without a trial, the two Houses of Parliament were
unable to agree as to the mode of proceeding. It was
obvious on all sides that the charge of ‘treason’ would
fail. The Lords declared that on the articles imputing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>treason judgment must be given, before the articles imputing
‘other high crimes and misdemeanours’ could be
entered upon. They declared that the attempt of the
Commons to mix up the two was ‘a new and unjustifiable
proceeding.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Lords’ Journals</i>, vol. xx, p. 515, seqq. <i>Commons’ Journals</i>, vol. xviii.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The Commons refused to adduce evidence on
the charge of treason, and to take the issue upon that.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>State Trials</i>, vol. xv, 1164, seqq.</div>

<p class='c029'>On the first of July, 1717, the Earl was brought to the
bar to hear from the Lord High Steward a declaration that
‘Robert, Earl of <span class='sc'>Oxford</span>, is, by the unanimous vote of all
the Lords present, acquitted of the articles of impeachment
exhibited against him, by the House of Commons, for High
Treason and other high crimes and misdemeanours, and that
the said impeachment shall be and is hereby dismissed.’
Then the Steward said, ‘Lieutenant of the Tower, You are
now to discharge your prisoner.’</p>

<p class='c029'>On the third of July, the Earl resumed his seat as a peer
of Parliament. On the fourth, the Commons resolved to
address the King, beseeching him ‘to except Robert,
Earl of <span class='sc'>Oxford</span>, out of the Act of Grace which Your
Majesty has been graciously pleased to promise from the
throne, to the end the Commons may be at liberty to proceed
against the said Earl in a parliamentary way.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Journals</i>, vol. xviii, p. 617.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
No
such proceeding, of course, was taken or intended.</p>

<p class='c035'>For several years to come Lord <span class='sc'>Oxford</span> took part, from
time to time, in the business of Parliament. He served
often on Committees in these final years of his public life,
just as he had done during his early years of apprenticeship
in the Lower House. In the Lords, as in the Commons,
he was listened to with especial deference on points of parliamentary
law and privilege.</p>

<p class='c029'>From time to time, also, the Jacobite agitators, both at
home and abroad, made repeated appeals to him, direct or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>indirect, for countenance and help in their schemes. They
had, it seems, a confident hope that the sufferings and the
humiliation inflicted on him in the years 1715–1717 must
have so entirely alienated him from the reigning House, as
now, at all events, to have prepared him to be really their
fellow-conspirator, on the first occurrence of a promising
opportunity.

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Domestic Life of Lord Oxford.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Lord <span class='sc'>Oxford’s</span> private life was not less chequered by
rapid alternations of sunshine and of gloom than was his
political career. In August, 1713, he gratified a cherished
desire by the marriage of his son Edward, Lord <span class='sc'>Harley</span>,
with the Lady Henrietta <span class='sc'>Cavendish Holles</span>, daughter and
heiress of John, Duke of <span class='sc'>Newcastle</span> (who died in 1711).
With what Lord <span class='sc'>Harley</span> had already derived under the
Duke’s will, this marriage brought him an estate then
worth sixteen thousand pounds a year, and destined to
increase enormously in value. Three months afterwards
the Earl lost a dearly loved daughter, the Marchioness of
<span class='sc'>Caermarthen</span>, who died at the age of twenty-eight. It
was of her that <span class='sc'>Swift</span> wrote to him—‘I have sat down to
think of every amiable quality that could enter into the
composition of a lady, and could not single out one which
she did not possess in as high a perfection as human nature
is capable of. But as to your Lordship’s own particular,
as it is an unconceivable misfortune to have lost such a
daughter, so it is a possession which few can boast of to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>have had such a daughter. I have often said to your Lordship
that “I never knew any one by many degrees so happy
in their domestics as you;” and I affirm that you are so
still, though not by so many degrees....

You
began to be too happy for a mortal; much more happy
than is usual with the dispensations of Providence long to
continue.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Under the sorrows both of public and of private life it
was his wont to find a part of his habitual consolations in the
use, as well as in the increase, of his splendid library.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>History of the Harleian Library.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He
began the work of collection in youth, and to add to his
treasures was one of the matters which, at intervals, occupied
his latest thoughts.</p>

<p class='c029'>Among the famous Englishmen whose manuscripts
passed, either wholly or partially, into the Harleian Library
are to be counted Sir Thomas <span class='sc'>Smith</span>; John <span class='sc'>Fox</span>, the martyrologist;
John <span class='sc'>Stowe</span>, the historian; Edward, Lord
<span class='sc'>Herbert</span> of Cherbury; and Archbishop <span class='sc'>Sancroft</span>.
Among famous foreigners, Augustus <span class='sc'>Lomenie de Brienne</span>;
Peter <span class='sc'>Séguier</span>, Chancellor of France; and Gerard John
<span class='sc'>Vossius</span>. Perhaps the most extensive of the prior collections
which it had absorbed, in mass, was the assemblage
of manuscripts that had been gathered by Sir Symonds
<span class='sc'>D’Ewes</span>, whose acquisitions included a rich series of the
materials of English history.</p>

<p class='c029'>The inquiries which led to the purchase of the <span class='sc'>D’Ewes’</span>
Collection were the occasion of making fully known to
Robert <span class='sc'>Harley</span> a model librarian in the person of Humphrey
<span class='sc'>Wanley</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Humphrey Wanley; his Life, Letters, and Journal.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The latter portion of <span class='sc'>Wanley’s</span> life was
wholly devoted to the service of the Harleian Library, and
his employment there was a felicity, both for him and for it.
His journal of the incidents which occurred during the
growth of the collection given to his care is the most curious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>document in its kind which is known to exist. That
journal illustrates the literary history and the manners of
the time, not less amusingly than it exhibits the personal
character of its writer, and the fidelity with which he
worked at his task in life.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Wanley</span> was the son of a country parson, little known
to fame, but possessing some tincture of learning, and was
born at Coventry, on the 21st of March, 1673. In his
youth he attracted the favourable notice of his father’s
diocesan, William <span class='sc'>Lloyd</span>, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry
(and afterwards of Worcester), by whom he was sent to
Edmund Hall at Oxford. That hall he soon exchanged
for University College, on the persuasion of Dr. Arthur
<span class='sc'>Charlett</span>, by whose influence he was afterwards made an
Underkeeper of the Bodleian Library. He took no degree,
but won some distinction, whilst at Oxford, by the services
which he rendered to Dr. <span class='sc'>Mill</span> in collating the text
of the New Testament.</p>

<p class='c029'>On leaving the University, <span class='sc'>Wanley</span> went to London,
where he became Secretary to the Society for the Propagation
of Christian Knowledge. He translated <span class='sc'>Ostervald’s</span>
<i>Grounds and Principles of the Christian Religion</i>; and
compiled a valuable Catalogue of the Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts
preserved in the chief libraries of Great Britain.
The last-named labour gave proof of much ability. It was
a sample of the work for which its writer was best fitted.</p>

<p class='c029'>As Speaker of the House of Commons, <span class='sc'>Harley</span> took a
considerable part in organizing the Cottonian Library, when
it became a public institution under the Act of Parliament.
<span class='sc'>Wanley</span> proffered to the Speaker, on this occasion, some
advice about the necessary arrangements; became well
acquainted with <span class='sc'>Harley’s</span> bookishness, and saw how
eagerly he would welcome opportunities for the improvement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>of his own library, as well as of that newly acquired
by the Public.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The D’Ewes Collections and their History.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The Sir Symonds <span class='sc'>D’Ewes</span> of that generation was the
grandson of the diligent antiquary and politician who has
been heretofore mentioned in this volume as the close
friend of Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, and to whose labours, in a
twofold capacity, students of our history owe a far better
acquaintance with parliamentary debates, in the times both
of <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span> and of <span class='sc'>Cromwell</span>, than, but for him, would
have been possible. The grandson of the first Sir Symonds
had inherited from his ancestor a valuable library; but its
possession had no great charm for him. He was willing
to part with it, for due consideration, yet aware that he
was under an obligation, moral if not legal, not so to part
with his books as to lead to their dispersion.</p>

<p class='c029'>On that head, the original collector had thus expressed
himself in his last Will:—‘I bequeath to Adrian <span class='sc'>D’Ewes</span>,
my young son yet lying in the cradle, or to any other of
my sons, hereafter to be born, who shall prove my heir (if
God shall vouchsafe unto me a masculine heir by whom
my surname and male line may be continued in the ages
to come), my precious library, in which I have stored up,
for divers years past, with great care, cost, and industry,
divers originals and autographs,&#160;... and such [books]
as are unprinted; and it is my inviolable injunction and
behest that he keep it entire, and not sell, divide, or dissipate
it. Neither would I have it locked up from furthering
the public good, the advancing of which I have always
endeavoured; but that all lovers of learning, of known
virtue and integrity, might have access to it at reasonable
times, so that they did give sufficient security to restore
safely any original or autograph&#160;... borrowed out of the
same,&#160;... without blotting, erasing, or defraying it. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>if God hath decreed now at last to add an end to my family
in the male line, His most holy and just will be done!’
In that case, the testator proceeds to declare, it is his
desire that the library should pass to his daughter and her
heirs, on like conditions as to its perpetual preservation, so
‘that not only all lovers of learning&#160;... may have access
to it at seasonable times, but also that all collections which
concern mine own family, or my wife’s, may freely be lent&#160;... to members thereof,’ &amp;c.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>D’Ewes, <i>Autobiography</i>, in MS. Harl. (B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Then the testator adds—in
relation to the last-named clause—an averment that he
had ‘only sought after the very truth, as well in these
things as in all other my elucubrations, whilst I searched
amongst the King’s records or public offices.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Wanley’s account of the acquisition of the D’Ewes Library.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>It having come to <span class='sc'>Wanley’s</span> knowledge or belief, in the
year 1703, that possibly arrangements might be made to
obtain this library, for the Public, from the then possessor,
he wrote to <span class='sc'>Harley</span> in these terms:—‘Sir Symonds
<span class='sc'>D’Ewes</span> being pleased to honour me with a peculiar kindness
of esteem, I have taken the liberty of inquiring of him
whether he will part with his library, and I find that he is
not unwilling to do so. And that at a much easier rate
than I could think for. I dare say that it would be a
noble addition to the Cotton Library; perhaps the best
that could be had anywhere at present.... If your Honour
should judge it impracticable to persuade Her Majesty to
buy them for the Cotton Library—in whose coffers such a
sum as will buy them is scarcely conceivable—then, Sir,
if you shall have a mind of them yourself I will take care
that you shall have them cheaper than any other person
whatsoever. I know that many have their eyes upon this
collection.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Wanley to Harley; MS. Lansd. 841, fol. 63. (B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘I am desirous,’ he goes on to say, ‘to have
this collection in town for the public good, and rather in a
public place than in private hands; but, of all private
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>gentlemen’s studies, first in yours. I have not spoken to
anybody as yet, nor will not till I have your answer, that
you may not be forestalled.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Harley</span> welcomed the overture thus made to him, and
<span class='sc'>Wanley</span>, on his behalf, entered upon a negotiation which
ended in the eventual acquisition of the whole of the
<span class='sc'>D’Ewes</span> Manuscripts for the Harleian Collection. Soon
afterwards, <span class='sc'>Wanley</span> became its librarian.</p>

<p class='c029'>In the course of this employment he watched diligently
for other opportunities of a like sort; established an active
correspondence with booksellers, both at home and abroad;
and induced Lord <span class='sc'>Oxford</span> to send agents to the Continent
to search for manuscripts.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>History of the Harleian Library, continued.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But the Earl had soon to meet
an eager rival in the book-market, in the person of Lord
<span class='sc'>Sunderland</span>, who in former years had been, by turns, his
colleague and his opponent in the keener strife of politics.
In their new rivalry, Lord <span class='sc'>Sunderland</span> had one considerable
advantage. He cared little about money. If he succeeded
in obtaining what he sought for, he rarely scrutinised
the more or less of its cost. <span class='sc'>Wanley</span> was by nature a
bargainer. He felt uneasy under the least suspicion that
any bookseller or vendor was getting the better hand of
him in a transaction. And he seems, in time, to have
inoculated Lord <span class='sc'>Oxford</span> with a good deal of the same
feeling. Some of the entries in his diary put this love of
striking a good bargain in an amusing light.</p>

<p class='c029'>Thus, for example, in telling of the acquisition of a valuable
monastic chartulary which had belonged to the
‘Bedford Library’ at Cranfield, he writes thus:—‘The
said Chartulary is to be my Lord’s, and he is to present
to that library <i>St. Chrysostom’s Works</i>, in Greek and Latin,
printed at Paris, for which my Lord shall be registered a
benefactor to the said library. Moreover, Mr. <span class='sc'>Frank</span> will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>send up a list of his out-of-course books, out of which my
Lord may pick and choose any twenty of them gratis.... I am
also to advise that he is heartily willing and ready to serve
his Lordship in any library matters;&#160;... particularly with [Sir
John] <span class='sc'>Osborne</span> of Chicksand Abbey, where most part of the
old monastical library is said yet to remain.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Wanley’s <i>Diary</i>, vol. i, pp. 13, 21. 1720, February.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And again, on
another occasion:—‘My Lord was pleased to tell me that
Mr. <span class='sc'>Gibson’s</span> last parcel of printed books were all his own
as being gained into [the bargain with] the two last parcels
of manuscripts bought of him.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ib.</i>, vol. ii, f. 24.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>Gibson’s</span> protest that he was
entitled to an additional thirty pounds was quite in vain.</p>

<p class='c029'>Of the innumerable skirmishes between librarian and
bookseller which <span class='sc'>Wanley’s</span> pages record with loving
detail, two passages may serve as sufficient samples:—‘<span class='sc'>Van
Hoeck</span>, a Dutchman’ he writes in 1722, ‘brought
to my Lord a small parcel of modern manuscripts, and their
lowest prices,—which proved so abominably wicked that
he was sent away with them immediately.’ And, in February,
1723:—‘<span class='sc'>Bowyer</span>, the bookseller, came intreating
me to instruct him touching the prices of old editions, and
of other rare and valuable books, pretending that thereby
he should be the better able to bid for them; but, as I
rather suppose, to be better able to exact of gentlemen. I
pleaded utter inexperience in the matter, and, without a
quarrel, in my mind rejected this ridiculous attempt with
the scorn it deserved.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Wanley’s <i>Diary</i>, vol. i, f. 73, verso. MS. Lansd., 771. (B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This may be a fresh instance of
the truth of <span class='sc'>Tullie’s</span> paradox, “that all fools are mad.”’</p>

<p class='c029'>In the year 1720, large additions were made, more
especially to the historical treasures of the Harleian
Library, by the purchase of manuscripts from the several
collections of John <span class='sc'>Warburton</span> (Somerset Herald), of
Archdeacon <span class='sc'>Battely</span>, and of Peter <span class='sc'>Séguier</span> (Chancellor of
France). Another important accession came, in the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>year, by the bequest of Hugh <span class='sc'>Thomas</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 35, 42, 48.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In 1721 purchases
were made from the several libraries of Thomas <span class='sc'>Grey</span>,
second Earl of <span class='sc'>Stamford</span>; of Robert <span class='sc'>Paynell</span>, of Belaugh,
in Norfolk; and of John <span class='sc'>Robartes</span>, first Earl of <span class='sc'>Radnor</span>.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord <span class='sc'>Oxford</span> died on the 21st May, 1724, at the age
of sixty-three.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Death of Lord Oxford.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>Wanley</span> records the event in these words:
‘It pleased God to call to His mercy Robert, Earl of
<span class='sc'>Oxford</span>, the founder of this Library, who long had been to
me a munificent patron.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Corresp., in <i>Works</i>, vol. xvi, p. 438.</div>

<p class='c029'>When condoling with the new Earl upon his father’s
death, <span class='sc'>Swift</span> wrote to him:—‘You no longer wanted his
care and tenderness,&#160;... but his friendship and conversation
you will ever want, because they are qualities so rare
in the world, and in which he so much excelled all others.
It has pleased me, in the midst of my grief, to hear that
he preserved the greatness, the calmness, and intrepidity,
of his mind to his last minutes; for it was fit that such a
life should terminate with equal lustre to the whole progress
of it.’ It is honourable alike to the man who was thus
generously spoken of, and to the friend who mourned his
loss, that the testimony so borne was a consistent testimony.
The failings of <span class='sc'>Harley</span> were well known to <span class='sc'>Swift</span>. In
the days of prosperity they had been freely blamed; and
face to face. When those days were gone, the good qualities
only came to be dwelt upon. To the unforgiving
enemy, as to the bereaved son, <span class='sc'>Swift</span> wrote about the
merits of the friend he had lost. ‘I pass over that paragraph
of your letter,’ said <span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span>, in reply, ‘which
is a kind of an elegy on a departed minister.’</p>

<p class='c035'>When the Harleian Library was inherited by the second
Earl of <span class='sc'>Oxford</span> (of this family) it included more than six
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>thousand volumes of Manuscripts, in addition to about
fourteen thousand five hundred charters and rolls. By
him it was largely augmented in every department.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Increase of the Harleian Library by Edward, Earl of Oxford.</span> 1724–1741.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>See MS. <span class='sc'>Addit.</span>, 5338. (B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He
made his library most liberally accessible to scholars; and
when, by a purchase made in Holland, he had acquired
some leaves of one of the most precious biblical manuscripts
in the world—leaves which had long before been
stolen from the Royal Library at Paris—he sent them back
to their proper repository in a manner so obliging as made
it apparent that his sense of the duties of collectorship was
as keen as was his sense of its delights. At his death, on
the 16th of June, 1741, the volumes of manuscripts had
increased to nearly eight thousand. The printed books
were estimated at about fifty thousand volumes, exclusive
of an unexampled series of pamphlets, amounting to nearly
400,000, and comprising, like the manuscripts, materials
for our national history of inestimable value.</p>

<p class='c029'>The only daughter and heiress of the second Earl, Margaret,
by her marriage with William, Duke of <span class='sc'>Portland</span>,
carried her share in a remnant of the fortunes of the several
families of <span class='sc'>Cavendish</span>, <span class='sc'>Holles</span>, and <span class='sc'>Harley</span>, into the family
of <span class='sc'>Bentinck</span>. The magnificent printed library which formed
part of her inheritance was sold and dispersed.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Johnson, <i>Account of the Harleian Library</i>; <i>Works</i>, vol. v, p. 181.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It was
of that collection that <span class='sc'>Johnson</span> said, ‘It excels any library
that was ever yet offered to sale in the value as well as
in the number of the volumes which it contains.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The Manuscripts were eventually purchased by Parliament
for the sum of ten thousand pounds.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The purchase of the Harleian MSS. for the Nation.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
With reference
to this purchase the Duchess of <span class='sc'>Portland</span> wrote as
follows, in April, 1753, to the Speaker of the House of
Commons:—‘As soon as I was acquainted with the proposal
you had made in the House of Commons, in relation
to my Father’s Collection of Manuscripts I informed my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>Mother [the then Dowager Countess of <span class='sc'>Oxford</span>] of it, who
has given the Duke of <span class='sc'>Portland</span> and me full power to do
therein as we shall think fit.</p>

<p class='c029'>‘Though I am told the expense of collecting them was
immense, and that, if they were to be dispersed, they would
probably sell for a great deal of money, yet, as a sum has
been named, and as I know it was my Father’s and is my
Mother’s intention that they should be kept together, I
will not bargain with the Publick. I give you this trouble
therefore to acquaint you that I am ready to accept of your
proposal upon condition that this great and valuable Collection
shall be kept together in a proper repository, as an
addition to the Cotton Library, and be called by the name
of the Harleian Collection of Manuscripts.</p>

<p class='c029'>‘I hope you do me the justice to believe that I do not
consider this as a sale for an adequate price.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Duchess of Portland to Arthur Onslow; MS. <span class='sc'>Addit.</span>, 17521, f. 30. (B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But your
idea is so right, and so agreeable to what I know was my
Father’s intention, that I have a particular satisfaction in
contributing all I can to facilitate the success of it.’</p>

<p class='c035'>If it were possible to give, in few words, any adequate
view of the obligations which English literature, and more
especially English historical literature, owes to the Collectors
of the Harleian Manuscripts, there could be no fitter conclusion
to a biographical notice of Robert <span class='sc'>Harley</span>. Here,
however, no such estimate is practicable. Nor, in truth,
can it be needed in order to convince the reader that ‘some
tribute of veneration’—to use the apposite words which
<span class='sc'>Johnson</span> prefixed to the Harleian Catalogue—is due to the
ardour of the two <span class='sc'>Harleys</span> for literature; and ‘to that
generous and exalted curiosity which they gratified with
incessant searches and immense expense; and to which
they dedicated that time and that superfluity of fortune
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>which many others, of their rank, employ in the pursuit of
contemptible amusements or the gratification of guilty
passions.’</p>

<h5 class='c019'><span class='sc'>Note to Chapter V.</span></h5>

<p class='c040'><i>EXTRACTS FROM THE STUART PAPERS, REFERRING TO
INTERCOURSE OF ROBERT HARLEY, EARL OF OXFORD,
WITH THE JACOBITES, AFTER THE ACCESSION OF
GEORGE I.</i></p>

<p class='c035'>1. [1717?] A document which, could it be recovered, would go far
towards clearing up some of the uncertainties which exist as to Lord
Oxford’s intercourse with the Pretender and his agents, subsequently to
the death of Queen Anne, was seen by Sir James Mackintosh among the
Stuart Papers acquired by George the Fourth. It was afterwards
vainly searched for by Lord Mahon, when engaged upon his <i>History of
England, from the Peace of Utrecht</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Edin. Rev.</i>, vol. lxii, pp. 18, 19.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is still known only from the
cursory notes made by Mackintosh, and referred to by a writer in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i> in these words: ‘During Oxford’s confinement in the
Tower there is a communication from him to the Pretender, preserved
among the Stuart Papers, offering his services and advice; recommending
the Bishop of Rochester as the fittest person to manage the
Jacobite affairs,—the writer himself being in custody; and adding that
he should never have thought it safe ‘<i>to engage again</i> with His Majesty
if Bolingbroke himself had been still about him.’</p>

<p class='c029'>2. 1717. September 29. Bishop <span class='sc'>Atterbury</span> to Lord <span class='sc'>Mar</span>:—</p>

<p class='c029'>‘Your accounts of what has been said here concerning some imaginary
differences abroad have not so much foundation as you may suppose.
At least, if they have, I am a stranger to it.... The result of any
discourse I shall have with [the Earl of Oxford?] will be sure to reach
you by his means.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Stuart Papers</i>, 1717.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
You will, I suppose, have a full account of affairs
here from his and other hands.’</p>

<p class='c029'>3. [1717?] The same to the same.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Ibid.</i></div>

<p class='c029'>‘Distances and other accidents have, for some years, interrupted my
correspondence with [the Earl of Oxford?] but I am willing to renew it,
and to enter into it upon a better foot than it has ever yet stood, being
convinced that my so doing may be of no small consequence to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>service. I have already taken the first step towards it that is proper in
our situation, and will pursue that by others as fast as I can have opportunity;
hoping that the secret will be as inviolably kept on your side as
it shall be on this, so far as the nature of such a transaction between
two persons who must see one another sometimes can pass unobserved.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Edin. Rev.</i>, as before.</div>

<p class='c029'>4. 1721. ‘Among the same papers,’ says the Reviewer quoted on the
previous page, ‘there is a letter from Mrs. Oglethorpe to the Pretender
(Jan. 17, 1721), containing assurances from Lord Oxford of his eternal
respect and good wishes, which from accidental circumstances he had
been unable to convey in the usual manner.’</p>

<p class='c029'>5. 1722. April 14. <span class='sc'>The Pretender</span> [to Lord <span class='sc'>Oxford</span>?]</p>

<p class='c029'>‘If you have not heard sooner or oftener from me, it hath not, I can
assure you, been my fault. Neither do I attribute to yours the long
silence you have kept on your side, but to a chain of disappointments
and difficulties which hath been also the only reason of my not finding
all this while a method of conveying my thoughts to you, and receiving
your advice, which I shall ever value as I ought, because I look upon
you not only as an able lawyer but a sincere friend.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Stuart Papers</i>, 1722.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This will, I hope,
come soon to your hands, and the worthy friend by whose canal I send
it will accompany it, by my directions, with all the lights and information
he or I can give, and which it is therefore useless to repeat here.’</p>

<p class='c029'>6. 1722. April 16. <span class='sc'>The Pretender</span> to <span class='sc'>Atterbury</span>.</p>

<p class='c029'>‘I am sensible of the importance of secrecy in such an affair, yet I do
not see how it will be possible to raise a sufficient sum, or to make a
reasonable concert in England, without letting some more persons into
the project.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ibid.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
You on the place are best judge how these points are to
be compassed, but I cannot but think that [the Earl of Oxford?] might
be of great use on this occasion. [Lord Lansdowne?] is to write to him
on the subject, and I am confident that if you two were to compare notes
together you would be able to contrive and settle matters on a more
sure and solid foundation than they have hitherto been.’</p>

<p class='c029'>7. 1722. In a report made to the Earl of Mar by George Kelly, one
of his emissaries employed in England, it is stated that on the delivery,
by Kelly, of Mar’s letter to Atterbury, the prelate asked the messenger
if he had anything to say, in addition to the contents of the letter, and
that he replied (in the jargon of his calling): ‘It is a proposal for
joining stocks with the Earl of Oxford, and taking the management of
the Company’s business into their hands.’ Atterbury, according to this
story, required a day’s deliberation, and then told Kelly that he was
‘resolved to join both heart and hand with the Earl; and not only so,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>but in the management and course of the business he would shew him
all the deference and respect that was due to a person who had so justly
filled the stations which he had been in.’ The Bishop, says Kelly, also
added that he was ‘resolved to dedicate the remainder of his days to the
King’s service, and proposed, by this reunion, to repay some part of the
personal debt which he owed to the Earl of Oxford, to whom he would
immediately write upon this subject.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ibid.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The messenger goes on to assure
Lord Mar that Atterbury ‘is entirely of your opinion that there is not
much good to be expected from the present managers, and thinks it no
great vanity to say that the Earl of Oxford and himself are the fittest
persons for this purpose; but the chief success of their partnership will
depend upon the secrecy of it.’</p>

<p class='c035'>Of the genuineness of the several letters,—of the credit due to the
emissaries and their reports,—even of the accurate identification,
in some instances, of the ‘Mr. Hackets,’ ‘Houghtons,’ and numerous
other pseudonyms, under which ‘Lord Oxford’ is assumed to be veiled,
there are, as yet, no adequate means of judging.</p>

<p class='c029'>The history of the rise and growth of our English trade
is, in a conspicuous degree, a history of the immigration
hither of foreign refugees, and of what was achieved by
their energy and industry, when put forth to the utmost
under the stimulus and the stern discipline of adversity.
Other countries, no doubt, have derived much profit from
a similar cause, but none, in Europe, to a like extent. By
turns almost all the chief countries of the Continent have
sent us bands of exiles, who brought with them either
special skill in manual arts and manufactures, or special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>capabilities for expanding our foreign commerce. To
Flemish refugees, and more particularly to those of them
who were driven hither by Spanish persecution in the
sixteenth century, England owes a large debt in both
respects.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Flemish Exiles in England.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Our historians have given more prominence of
late years to this chapter in the national annals than was
ever given to it before, but there is no presumption in
saying that not a little of what was achieved by exiles towards
the industrial greatness of the nation has yet to be
told.</p>

<p class='c029'>Nor is it less evident that, over and above the political
and public interest of the things done, or initiated, by the
new comers in their adopted country, the personal and
family annals of the exiles possess, in not a few instances,
a remarkable though subsidiary interest of their own. In
certain cases, to trace the fortunes of a refugee family, is
at once to throw some gleams of light on obscure portions
of our commercial history, and to tell a romantic story of
real life.</p>

<p class='c029'>One such instance presents itself in the varied fortunes
of the <span class='sc'>Courtens</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Courtens; their Adventures and Enterprises.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
That family attained an unusual degree
of commercial prosperity, and attained it with unusual
rapidity. In the second generation it seemed—for a while—to
have struck a deep root in our English soil. It owned
lands in half-a-dozen English counties, and its alliance was
sought by some of the greatest families in the kingdom.
In the next generation its fortunes sank more rapidly than
they had risen. In the fourth, the last of the <span class='sc'>Courtens</span>
was for almost half his life a wanderer, living under a feigned
name, and he continued so to live when at length enabled
to return to his country. The true name had been preserved
only in the records of interminable litigation—in
England, Holland, India, and America—about the scattered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>wreck of a magnificent property. But the enterprise of the
family, in its palmy days, had planted for England a prosperous
colony. It had opened new paths to commerce in
the East Indies, as well as in the West. And its last
survivor found a solace for many ruined hopes in the collection
of treasures of science, art and literature, which
came to be important enough to form no small contribution
towards the eventual foundation of the British
Museum.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Founder of the Family.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>In 1567 William <span class='sc'>Courten</span>, a thriving dealer in linens
and silks, living at Menin in Flanders, was together with
his wife, Margaret <span class='sc'>Casier</span>, accused of heresy. <span class='sc'>Courten</span>
was thrown into the prison of the Inquisition, but contrived
both to make his escape into England, and to enable
his wife soon to join him. He established himself in London,
in the same business which had thriven with him
at home.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Family Records of the Courtens; in MS. Sloane, 3515, <i>passim</i>. (B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
His wife shared in its toils, and by skilfully
adapting her exertions to those tastes for finery in the
families of rich citizens which were now striving with some
success against the rigour of the old sumptuary laws
made the business more prosperous than before. It expanded
until the poor haberdasher of 1567 had become a
notability on the London Exchange.</p>

<p class='c029'>In 1571 a son was born to the exiles. This second
William <span class='sc'>Courten</span> was bred as a merchant rather than as
a tradesman. He had good parts, and seems to have
started into life with a passion for bold enterprise. His
early training in London was continued at Haerlem, and
there he laid a foundation for commercial success by marrying
the daughter of Peter <span class='sc'>Crommelinck</span>, a wealthy merchant.
First and last, his wife brought him a dowry of
£40,000, of which sum it was stipulated by the father’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>will that not less than one half should be laid out in the
purchase of lands in England, to be settled on the eldest
son that should be born of the marriage.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Sir William Courten and his Mercantile Pursuits.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>By the time of his attaining the age of five and thirty
William <span class='sc'>Courten</span> had already become—for that period—a
great capitalist. He then, in 1606, established in London
a commercial house which added to the ordinary business
of merchants on the largest scale, that of marine insurers,
and also that of adventurers in the whale fishery. His
partners in the firm were his younger brother, Peter
<span class='sc'>Courten</span>, and John <span class='sc'>Mouncey</span>. One half of the joint stock
belonged to the founder; the other half was divided between
the junior partners.</p>

<p class='c029'>For nearly a quarter of a century this mercantile partnership
prospered marvellously. Its annual returns are said
to have averaged £200,000. It built more than twenty
large ships, and kept in constant employment more than
four hundred seamen and fishermen. The head of the firm
gradually acquired a large landed property which included
estates in the several counties of Worcester, Gloucester,
Leicester, Nottingham, Essex, and Kent.</p>

<p class='c029'>This great prosperity had, of course, its drawbacks.
Amongst the earliest checks which are recorded to have
befallen it was a Crown prosecution of <span class='sc'>Courten</span> (in company
with several other foreign merchants of note, among
whom occur the names of <span class='sc'>Burlamachi</span>, <span class='sc'>Vanlore</span>, and
<span class='sc'>De Quester</span>) on the frequent charge—so obnoxious to the

<span class='sc'>Courten</span> was brought into the Star Chamber and
was fined £20,000; a sum so enormous as to excite a
suspicion of the accuracy of the record, but for its repeated
entry. The prosecution was instituted in June, 1619; the

<div class='sidenote'>1626. <span class='sc'>Colonial Enterprises of Sir Wm. Courten.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>In 1626, William <span class='sc'>Courten</span>—then Sir William, having
received the honour of knighthood at Greenwich, on the
31st of May, 1622—petitioned the King for ‘licence to make
discoveries and plant colonies in that southern part of the
world called <i>Terra Australis incognita</i>, with which the
King’s subjects have as yet no trade,’ and his petition was
granted.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Domestic Corresp.</i>, Charles I, vol. xiv, § 33.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
What ensued thereupon is thus told in an
authoritative manuscript account preserved in the Sloane
collection:—</p>

<p class='c029'>‘Sir William <span class='sc'>Courten</span> being informed, by his correspondents
in Zealand, that some Dutch men-of-war sent out
upon private commission against the Spaniards had put
into the island of Barbados, and found it uninhabited, and
very fit for a plantation, did thereupon, at his own charge,
set forth two ships provided with men, ammunition, and
arms, and all kinds of necessaries for planting and fortifying
the country, who landed and entered into possession of the
same in the month of February, 1626 [1627, N.S.]... Afterwards,
in the same year, he sent Captain <span class='sc'>Powell</span> thither,
with a further supply of servants and provisions, who, in
1627, fetched several Indians from the mainland, with
divers sorts of seeds and roots, and agreed with them to
instruct the English in planting cotton, tobacco, indigo, &amp;c.
Sir William <span class='sc'>Courten</span> having, by his partners and servants,
maintained the actual possession for the space of
two years, and peopled the island with English, Indians,
and others, to the number of eighteen hundred and fifty
men, women, and children, thought fit to make use of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Earl of <span class='sc'>Pembroke’s</span> name in obtaining a patent particularly
for Barbadoes, although he had before a general grant
from the king to possess any land within a certain latitude,
wherein this island was comprehended. His Majesty
having thus granted, by his Letters Patent, dated 25 February,
1627 [1628, N.S.] the government of this island unto
the Earl of <span class='sc'>Pembroke</span>, in trust for Sir William <span class='sc'>Courten</span>,
with power to settle a colony according to the laws of
England, Captain <span class='sc'>Powell</span> had a commission to continue
there as Governor, in their behalf. The Earl of <span class='sc'>Carlisle</span>,’
continues the MS. narrative, ‘having, before this Patent to the
Earl of <span class='sc'>Pembroke</span>, procured a grant, dated 2nd July 1627,
of all those islands lying within 10 and 20 degrees of latitude
by the name of Carliola, or Carlisle Province, with all
royalties, and jurisdictions, as amply as they were enjoyed
by any Bishop of Durham, within his bishopric or county
palatine, and having also got another patent, for the greater
security of his title, dated 7th April 1628, sent one Henry
<span class='sc'>Hawley</span> with two ships, who, arriving there in 1629, invited
the Governor on board, kept him prisoner, seized the
forts, and carried away the factors and servants of Sir
William <span class='sc'>Courten</span> and the Earl of <span class='sc'>Pembroke</span>.

The authority
of the Earl of <span class='sc'>Carlisle</span> being thus established was
maintained.’</p>

<p class='c029'>But it was only maintained after a long contest at the
Council Board at home, which contest seems to have been
largely influenced by the fluctuations of Court favour from
time to time. A despatch in February, written in behalf
of <span class='sc'>Carlisle</span>, is followed in April by another despatch
written in behalf of <span class='sc'>Pembroke</span> and <span class='sc'>Courten</span>. The one
fact that becomes consistently evident throughout the proceedings
is that grants of this kind were made in the loosest
fashion, and often in entire ignorance even of the geographical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>positions of the countries given by them.<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c030'><sup>[39]</sup></a> Indeed, the
common course of procedure under the <span class='sc'>Stuarts</span>, when a
courtier had the happy thought of begging a territory in
America, reminds one of those earlier days of the <span class='sc'>Tudors</span>,
when a favoured suppliant sometimes obtained the grant
of a monastery, or the lease of a broad episcopal estate,
with hardly more trouble than it cost him to win a royal
smile.</p>

<p class='c029'>To <span class='sc'>Courten</span> and his colonists the issue of this quarrel
about Barbadoes was very disastrous. To some of the
latter it brought ruin. But to the founder himself a check
to enterprise in one direction seems to have brought increased
stimulus to new enterprise in another direction.
He now embarked largely in adventures to the East Indies
and to China. As usual, they were planned on a magnificent
scale; excited great jealousy in the breasts of competitors;
and were attended, in the long run, with very
mixed results of good and ill.</p>

<p class='c029'>Meanwhile, Sir William’s growing wealth—greatly exaggerated
by popular renown—and the conspicuous position
into which his varied pursuits had brought him, led to
plans of enterprise by others, and of quite another kind, at
home. He had lost his first wife, and also his eldest son.
He had married a second wife,—Hester <span class='sc'>Tryon</span>, daughter
of Peter <span class='sc'>Tryon</span>. Only one son survived, but Sir William
had three daughters, whose prospective charms attracted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>many suitors. In September, 1624, King <span class='sc'>James</span> wrote a
characteristic letter in which he assured <span class='sc'>Courten</span> that the
son of Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Fleetwood</span>, Lord of the Scottish barony
of Newton, would make a fit match for one of the three
daughters, and that the conclusion of such a match would
be very acceptable to the King himself.

<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>James I to Sir Willm. Courten; <i>Dom. Corr.</i>, vol. clxxii, § 71.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The pretendant
would gladly, and impartially, wed any one of the three
ladies, but the King himself, continues the royal letter,
‘will regard, as a favour, any increase of portion given to
the daughter whom <span class='sc'>Fleetwood</span> may marry, over and
above the portion given to, or intended for, the other
daughters.’</p>

<p class='c029'>But despite so powerful a recommendation the young
Baron of <span class='sc'>Newton</span> failed in his suit. Among the aspirants
with whom he stood in competition were men much higher
in social position. Eventually, the eldest daughter married
Sir Edward <span class='sc'>Lyttelton</span> of Staffordshire. The second
daughter married Henry <span class='sc'>Grey</span>, eighth Earl of Kent, of
that family. And the third married Sir Richard <span class='sc'>Knightley</span>
of Fawsley.</p>

<p class='c029'>Royal commendations of suitors were sure, in that age,
not to be the only sample of royal letters—direct and indirect—with
which a man in Sir William <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> position
became familiar. He was favoured with not a few solicitations
for advances of money on privy-seals, and in other
forms of ‘loan.’ Sometimes he complies. Sometimes he
remonstrates by specifying the large sums he contributes
to the revenue in the way of custom’s duties, and the
entire incapability thence arising of the desired response to
privy-seals and the like documents. His loans, however,
to <span class='sc'>James</span>, and to <span class='sc'>Charles</span>, amounted to no less a sum than
£27,000.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Commercial Complications in Holland.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The death in 1625 of his brother, Sir Peter <span class='sc'>Courten</span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>deprived the firm of its efficient representative in Holland,
and laid a foundation for great misfortunes by putting in
his place an unworthy successor. The partner resident at
Middleburgh had the trust both of a large portion of the
capital of the Company, and of the chief share of its account
keeping.</p>

<p class='c029'>Peter <span class='sc'>Boudaen</span> was a nephew of the <span class='sc'>Courtens</span>, and
had been to some extent admitted as a partner. His uncle
Peter made him also his executor. He thus acquired a
great control over the continental affairs of the house, just
at the time when its transactions were expanding in all
directions.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1631.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He proved unfaithful to his trust, applied his
large local influence to his personal advantage and to the
prejudice of his partners; and at length failed altogether
to render due accounts to the two partners in England.
<span class='sc'>Mouncey</span>, the junior of these, went to Holland in order to
enforce an adjustment. He had hardly entered on his
task when he died, after a very brief illness, in <span class='sc'>Boudaen’s</span>
house at Middleburgh. <span class='sc'>Boudaen</span> made a Will for
him; asserted that the testator had executed it, in due
form of law, immediately before his death; and found
means to get the document sanctioned by the Dutch
Courts, in the face of strong opposition and of strong
presumptive evidence of fraud.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Establishment by Sir W. Courten of the British Fishery Association.</span></div>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Domest. Corresp.</i>, Charles I, vol. cclxxxvii, § 57; vol. ccciii, § 75; cccxiii, § 16; cccxvii, § 75.</div>

<p class='c029'>Sir William <span class='sc'>Courten</span>, meanwhile, prosecuted with his
characteristic vigour his vast enterprises already established;
made new and large ventures in the reclaiming of waste
lands in England; and established the ‘Fishery Association
of Great Britain and Ireland,’ with a view to the
rescue from the Dutch of that productive herring fishery
on our own coasts, which the growing supineness of
English governments during at least two generations had
permitted to become almost a monopoly in their hands.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Of this Association <span class='sc'>Courten</span>, during the closing years of
his life, was the mainspring.</p>

<p class='c029'>The Dutch, as was natural, strove vigorously to retain
the advantage they had acquired, and were little scrupulous
about the means of opposition. English herring busses
were occasionally captured. And the captors had the great
incidental advantage in the strife of dealing with a Government
already weak at home, and yearly losing ground.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Trade with India.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The East Indian adventures were, at length, attended by
circumstances still more complex than those pertaining to
the fishery business at home, or to the trading in Holland.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Domestic Corresp.</i>, Charles I, vol. cccxxiii, p. 58; vol. cccxliii, § 19.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For, in the former, English rivalry had to be encountered,
as well as Dutch rivalry. And the rivalry took such a
shape as to make the carrying on of trade extremely like
the carrying on of war. But, as if the care of these varied
interests, in addition to all the toils and anxieties of ordinary
commerce on an extraordinary scale, were all too little
to occupy the mind of a man who had now reached his
sixty-sixth year, we find Sir William <span class='sc'>Courten</span> taking, just
at the close of life, a new and leading part in the business
of redeeming captives who had been taken by the pirates
of Morocco and Algiers.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Domestic Corresp.</i>, Charles I, vol. cccxv, § 16; vol. ccclxviii, § 82.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Nor was this merely an affair
of the provision of money and the conduct of correspondence.
It involved an intimate acquaintance with the circumstances
and the needs of the Barbary States, being
carried on, in part, on the principle of barter.</p>

<p class='c035'>But all these far-spread activities were now fast approaching
their natural close. <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> career had been,
as a whole, wonderfully prosperous, until very near its
close. Already it contained, indeed, the germ of a series
of reverses, hardly less remarkable; but the growth of that
germ was to depend on the as yet unseen course of public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>events. His ambition to ‘found a family’ had also been
gratified by the marriage of his only surviving son<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c030'><sup>[40]</sup></a>—William
<span class='sc'>Courten</span>, third of his name—with the Lady
Katherine <span class='sc'>Egerton</span>, daughter of John <span class='sc'>Egerton</span>, Earl of
Bridgewater.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Courten
Papers</i>, in
MS. Sloane,
3515.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
On that son and his heirs, Sir William
<span class='sc'>Courten</span> settled landed estates amounting to nearly
seven thousand pounds a year.</p>

<p class='c029'>Sir William <span class='sc'>Courten</span> died in June, 1636. The commercial
enterprises of all kinds which were in full activity
at the time of his death were continued by his son, who
inherited large claims, large responsibilities, and large
perils. And it was of the perils that—after his succession—he
had earliest experience.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The third William Courten.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Just before the father’s death, a complaint had been
made to the Privy Council that certain ships which he had
sent to Surat and other places had committed acts of
‘piracy near the mouth of the Red Sea.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Domestic Corresp.</i>, Charles I, vol. cccxliii, § 19.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It appeared
afterwards that the ships which had given cause, or
pretext, of complaint were not <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> ships, but the
accusation entailed trouble, and was, to the heir, the
beginning of troubles to come. The opposition of the
East India Company to the Indian trading of ‘interlopers’
(as they were called already) was unremitting and
bitter.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Courten Papers</i>, in MS. Sloane, 3515, p. 38.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In June, 1637, William <span class='sc'>Courten</span>, with a view to
arm himself for the encounter, obtained from the Crown
letters patent which empowered himself and his associates
to trade with all parts of the East, ‘wheresoever the East
India Company had not settled factories or trade before
the twelfth day of December, 1635.’ One of his chief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>associates under the new grant was Endymion <span class='sc'>Porter</span>, and
it appears that it was partly by <span class='sc'>Porter’s</span> influence at
Court that the grant had been procured.</p>

<p class='c029'>Renewed activity was now shown in prosecuting the
Eastern trade; new and large ventures were made in it.
On some occasions as many as seven well-appointed ships
were sent out by <span class='sc'>Courten</span> and his associates at one time.
Instructions are still extant which were given to the chief
agents, supercargoes, and factors, for the settlement of
English factories at many important places where none had
heretofore existed. They are marked by great sagacity
and breadth of view, and, in several points, contrast
advantageously with contemporary documents of a like kind.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Seizure by the Dutch of the Bona Esperanza and Henry Bonadventure in the Indian Seas.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The enterprise was pursued, as it seems, with satisfactory
results until the year 1643, when, in the Straits of
Malacca, two richly-laden vessels of the <span class='sc'>Courten</span> fleet were
seized by the Dutch. Subsequent proceedings show that
the value of the ships and their cargoes, with the contingent
losses, exceeded £150,000. Along with this severe blow
came the interruptions and injuries to trade at home, which
were the inevitable accompaniment of the Civil War.
Soon after it, there came indications that the loss to Sir
William <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> representatives by the misconduct of
Peter <span class='sc'>Boudaen</span> at Middleburgh would but too probably
prove to be a loss without present remedy. It appears to
have been established by the evidence adduced in the
course of the almost interminable litigation which ensued
that there was due from <span class='sc'>Boudaen</span> to his partners a sum of
£122,000; none of which, it may be added, seems ever to
have been recovered. And the debt which had been contracted
by <span class='sc'>James the First</span> and his successor, though
less grievous in amount, was at this time even more
hopeless.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Under the pressure of such a combination of misfortunes,
William <span class='sc'>Courten</span> found himself practically and suddenly
insolvent. He met some of the most pressing claims upon
him by the sale of available portions of his landed property.
He assigned other portions of his estates to trustees, and
became himself an exile. He survived the ruin of the brilliant
hopes and expectations to which he had been born
about ten years; dying at Florence in the year 1655. He
left, by his marriage with Lady Katherine <span class='sc'>Egerton</span>, one
son and one daughter.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>William Courten, Founder of the Sloane Museum.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The fourth William <span class='sc'>Courten</span> was born in London on
the 28th March, 1642. He was baptized at St. Gabriel
Fenchurch, on the 31st of that month. The downfall of
his family was therefore very nearly contemporaneous with
his own birth, and makes it explicable that no record can
now be found of the places of his education, or of the
course of his early years. But the first trace which does
occur of him is in exact harmony with the one fact which
makes his existence memorable to his countrymen.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Museum Tradescantianum</i>, (1656).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He
appears, at the age of fourteen, in the list of benefactors to
the Tradescant Museum, at Lambeth, a collection which
afterwards became the basis of the Ashendean Museum at
Oxford.</p>

<p class='c029'>The Tradescants—father and son—hold a conspicuous
place in the history of Botanical Science in England, and
they are especially notable as the founders of the first
‘Museum’ worthy of the name, which was established in
this country. The next collection of note, after theirs, was
that formed by Robert <span class='sc'>Hubert</span>, in his house near St. Paul’s
Cathedral. Other collectors—as for example, John <span class='sc'>Conyers</span>
and Dr. John <span class='sc'>Woodward</span>—soon followed the example.
But in this path all of them were far outstripped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>by <span class='sc'>Courten</span>, who had marked his early bias, and also his
characteristic liberality, by his gift to the <span class='sc'>Tradescants</span> in
1656.</p>

<p class='c029'>Part of <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> youth was passed at Montpelier, where
he formed the acquaintance of several men then, or afterwards,
famous for their scientific acquirements. Amongst
them, and with the local advantages for the study of the
natural sciences, in particular, for the possession of which
Montpelier was already noted, his tastes for observation
and study were developed, and his character took the ply
which soon became indelible.</p>

<p class='c029'>If he ever possessed any share at all of the qualities and
predispositions for mercantile adventure, which had marked
so many generations of his ancestors on the father’s side,
that share was far too weak an element in his composition
to resist the discouragements of adverse circumstances.
But as he attained manhood, he found himself immersed—unwittingly
in part—in a sea of litigation which boded
ill to his prospective enjoyment of leisure for scientific
studies, whatever might prove to be its ultimate results
upon his worldly fortunes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The suits and claims instituted by George Carew, on behalf of Courten and of the Creditors.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Some of the later enterprises of Sir William <span class='sc'>Courten</span>
had been carried on in conjunction with another famous
merchant, Sir Paul <span class='sc'>Pindar</span>, who like himself was a large
creditor of the Crown. The administration of <span class='sc'>Pindar’s</span>
estate had fallen into the hands of a certain George <span class='sc'>Carew</span>,
who seems to have imagined that the restoration of royal
authority in England would bring with it opportunities, to
an energetic man, of winning a new fortune out of the
remnants of the old fortunes which the fall of royalty had
helped to ruin.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Courten Papers</i>, in MSS. Sloane, 3515; 3961; and 3962.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Just before <span class='sc'>Charles the Second</span> came
back, this man busied himself in buying up claims against
<span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> estate as well as claims against <span class='sc'>Pindar’s</span>. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>had a stock of energy. He had also the prospect of acquiring
a good standpoint at Court, in addition to his
present possession of a good training in the mysteries of
English law. He was ready to devote all his energies to
the business, and to encounter at once with the Dutch East
India Company, the Dutch Republic, the Government of
Barbadoes, and a host of adversaries at home.</p>

<p class='c029'>There had, however, been no Commission of Bankruptcy.
It was necessary that the battle should be fought as well
in the name of the heir and representative of the family, as
in the name of the collective body of creditors. <span class='sc'>Carew</span>
used <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> name and used it, as it appears, for some
years without authority from the legal guardian. <span class='sc'>Courten</span>
himself did not become of age until 1663.</p>

<p class='c029'>The Restoration was hardly effected before <span class='sc'>Carew</span> besieged
the King and the Courts with Petitions, Memorials,
Claims, and Bills of Plaint. He would lose nothing for
lack of asking. And he was undeterred by difficulties or
rebuffs.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Barbadoes Claim.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The case of Barbadoes was thus put before the Committee
of the Privy Council for America:—</p>

<p class='c029'>‘<span class='sc'>Courten</span> claims the whole island of Barbadoes; and,
more particularly, the Corn Plantation, the Indian Bridge
Plantation, the Fort Plantation, the Indian Plantation eastwards,
and Powell’s plantation. Sir William <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> ships
discovered the island in the year 1626, and left fifty people
there. Captain Henry <span class='sc'>Powell</span> landed there in February,
1627, built [houses] for <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> colony, and left more
than forty inhabitants there. John <span class='sc'>Powell</span> erected Plantation
Fort, and remained until he was surprised in 1628 by a
force under Charles <span class='sc'>Wolverton</span>, by which the fort was
captured.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Colonial Correspondence</i>, vol. xiv, §§ 37, 39, 42.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In 1629, Sir William <span class='sc'>Courten</span> sent eighty
men with arms, in the ‘Peter and John,’ and they retook
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>the fort in the name of the Earl of <span class='sc'>Pembroke</span>, Trustee for
<span class='sc'>Courten</span>, according to the royal grant.’ And then the
Petition recites the recapture, under the conflicting Patent
of the Earl of Carlisle, as I have described it already.</p>

<p class='c029'>There is, of course, no foundation for the statement that
Barbadoes was ‘discovered’ by the ships of <span class='sc'>Courten</span>. In
other respects, the details here set forth appear to be sustained
by the evidence.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Domestic Corresp.</i>, Charles II, vol. xx, § 77; and xlviii, § 48.</div>

<p class='c029'>In order to the recovery of the debt from the Crown,
<span class='sc'>Carew</span> suggested, in another petition, and quite in the
fashion of the day, that the Petitioners should have ‘leave
to raise the money’ due to the <span class='sc'>Courten</span> Estate from the
estates of John <span class='sc'>Lisle</span>, Thomas <span class='sc'>Scott</span>, Thomas <span class='sc'>Andrews</span>,
and others, concerned in the murder of the late King. In
a third petition, he prayed that ‘a blank warrant for the
dignity of a baronet’ might be granted, in order to sell it
to the best bidder, and to apply the proceeds in partial
satisfaction of the debt.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Case of the East India Ships.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>But it was to the prosecution of the claim upon the Dutch
Republic for the unwarranted seizure, in 1643, of the rich
ships of the East India Fleet that <span class='sc'>Carew</span> devoted his best
energies. The damages were put at £163,400. The main
facts of the case were fully substantiated. And a royal
letter was addressed to the States General on the 21st of
March, 1662, claiming full satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c029'>A Memorial was delivered at the Hague in the April
following, by the English Ambassador, Sir George <span class='sc'>Downing</span>,
in which, after a general statement of the case at issue,
he went on to say: ‘Whereas it may seem strange that
this matter may be set on foot at this time, whereas in the
year 1654 Commissioners were sent to England who did
end several matters relating to the East Indies, and whereas
in the year 1659 several matters of a fresher date were also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>ended, and thereby a period put to all other matters of difference
which had happened about the same time, and were
known in Europe before the 20th of January in the same
year, it is to be considered that the persons interested in
these ships were such as, for their singular and extraordinary
activity to His Majesty,&#160;... father to the King my
master, were rendered incapable of obtaining or pursuing
their just rights, at home or abroad.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Memorial delivered to the States General</i>, at the Hague, 19 April, 1662.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And upon that
account it is that the business of the two ships remains yet
in dispute, though several matters of a much fresher date
have been ended.’</p>

<p class='c029'>When these proceedings were initiated by Sir George
<span class='sc'>Downing</span> at the Hague, <span class='sc'>Courten</span> himself was still in his
minority. But it is probable that he had already returned
to England.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> first personal appearance upon the scene was
also made in the way of presenting a petition to the King.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MS. Sloane 3515.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In July 1663, he thus alleged that the steps which had
been taken were without his concurrence or knowledge,
‘and, as is feared, with intention to deprive him of his
claims.’ The King referred the petition to Sir Geoffrey
<span class='sc'>Palmer</span>, who pronounced in <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> favour.</p>

<p class='c035'>His position was one of great embarrassment.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Agreement between Courten and Carew.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Some of
his family connexions had already suffered much annoyance
from litigation about the <span class='sc'>Courten</span> Estates at home, and
were little inclined to incur further risk or trouble on behalf
of a relative whose inheritance was certain to yield abundance
of immediate vexation and anxiety, and very uncertain
in respect to its prospects of any better harvest in
the end.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1663.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He was advised to sell the remnant of his entailed
estates, to put the product of the sale out of danger from
any adverse issue of pending claims, and to come to terms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>with <span class='sc'>Carew</span> for the prosecution of the latter—or of some
of them—on a joint account. In accordance with this
advice, an agreement was made, in the course of 1663, by
which <span class='sc'>Carew</span> was empowered to pursue the claims against
the Netherlands, as well on <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> behalf as on his own
and that of other creditors. The remaining landed estates
in Worcestershire and other counties—or nearly all that
remained of them—were sold, and a life income was secured.</p>

<p class='c029'>For the next half dozen years <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> life was almost
that of a recluse, save that such activities as it admitted of
were devoted almost exclusively to the study of antiquities
and of the natural sciences. A great part of those years
was passed at Fawsley with his aunt, Lady <span class='sc'>Knightley</span>, one
of the few relatives whose affection stood the proof of
adversity.</p>

<p class='c035'>There are several reasons for thinking that the rudimentary
foundation of <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> Museum had been laid as
early as in the time of his grandfather, Sir William, whose
mercantile and colonial enterprises presented so many opportunities
for bringing into England the more curious
productions of remote countries, as well as their merchandise.
Be that as it may, the collection of a museum which
should eclipse everything of its kind theretofore known in
England became, from his attainment of manhood, the
leading aim and object of William <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> career. It
was to him both an ambition and a solace.</p>

<p class='c029'>The other of the two men who thus came into brief
contact in 1663 lived a life as different from <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span>
as can well be conceived. <span class='sc'>Carew</span> seems to have been a
glutton in his appetite for contention.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Pretentien tegens d’Oost-Indische Compagnie</i>, &amp;c. (B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And the Dutchmen, as
far as they were concerned, put no stint upon its indulgence.
There was also ample time for it. Treaty followed by war,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>and war leading to renewed treaty, kept the affair of the
<i>Bona Esperanza</i> and the <i>Henry Bon-Adventure</i> both in
active historical memory, and in full legal vigour. Towards
the close of 1662 it had been covenanted by the English
government, as a necessary condition of a good understanding
between the two Powers, that there should be a
prompt satisfaction of damages. The Treaty of Commerce
of that year was tossed to and fro on that one point of the
<span class='sc'>Courten</span> ships with more obstinate pertinacity than on any
other. To the intrinsic merits of the claim, in the main,
there was really no answer. To the legal technicalities by
which its settlement, if left to Dutch courts of judicature,
could be indefinitely protracted, there was no end.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Claims in Holland.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When
letters of dismissal had been already drawn at Whitehall
for the Dutch envoys of 1662, because they insisted on a
clause extinguishing all outstanding claims on both sides;
they skilfully contrived to substitute leave to litigate<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c030'><sup>[41]</sup></a> for
a proviso to satisfy. And the event justified their forecast.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Domestic Corresp.</i>, Charles II, vol. cxiii, § 143.</div>

<p class='c029'>During the year 1665, Letters of Marque and Reprisal
were granted to <span class='sc'>Carew</span> and his associates, and a special
clause of continuance until the full recovery of debt and
damages,<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c030'><sup>[42]</sup></a> notwithstanding the conclusion of any subsequent
Treaty of Peace was inserted. This was done after
an elaborate argument before the Lord Chancellor <span class='sc'>Clarendon</span>.
Several ships were taken by <span class='sc'>Carew’s</span> cruisers, but
they were nearly all claimed by Hamburghers, Swedes, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>others. And at length the cost of the reprisals exceeded
their yield.</p>

<p class='c029'>In this case, and throughout it, as in so many other and
graver cases, the policy of <span class='sc'>Charles the Second’s</span> ministers
was a policy of the passing exigence. Principle had always
to vail to expediency. The Dutch were permitted, after
all, to insert their favorite extinction clause in the Treaty
of Breda (21 July, 1667). Five years later, the Privy
Council advised the King that ‘it is just and reasonable
for your Majesty to insist upon reparation for the debt and
damages’ sustained by the seizure, in 1643, of the <i>Bona
Esperanza</i> and her consort. New Letters of Marque led
to the capture of more vessels, duly provided with a diversity
of flag; and to the imprisonment, in England, of the
captors, before trial or inquiry. Meanwhile, <span class='sc'>Carew</span> himself
was seized abroad, and put into a Dutch prison.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Courten Papers</i>, in MS. Sloane, 3515.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And,
at length, in 1676, the States of Holland sent express orders
to their courts of judicature, directing that ‘no further
progress shall be made in the pending suits,’ grounding
the order upon the proviso in the treaty of 1667, as extinctive
of all claims and pretensions, whatsoever, advanced
by Englishmen against Dutch citizens, be the foundation
and history of such claims what they might. This decree,
therefore, operated in bar, as well of the claims of the representatives
of Sir William <span class='sc'>Courten</span>, for the debt of
Peter <span class='sc'>Boudaen</span>, as of those arising out of the seizure of
the ships of the East India Fleet. It was estimated that
the <span class='sc'>Courten</span> claims then pending in the Courts of Holland
amounted, in the aggregate, to £380,000 sterling.<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c030'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c029'>In May, 1683, a petition was presented to the English
government, in which humble prayer was made that that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>government would be graciously pleased ‘to perpetuate the
memory of Sir William <span class='sc'>Courten</span> and of Sir Paul <span class='sc'>Pindar</span>,
by setting up their statues in marble under the piazzas of
the Royal Exchange—Sir William <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> at the end
of the “Barbadoes walk” at the one side, and Sir Paul
<span class='sc'>Pindar’s</span> at the end of the “Turkey walk” of the other
side—for encouragement to all merchants, in future ages,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Vox Veritatis</i>, 1683. (B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to take examples by them for loyalty and fidelity to their
King and country.’</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Courten’s Second Visit to France, and his Travels.</span></div>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Courten</span> did his best to avoid any personal share in
those unceasing turmoils, and to keep in the quiet paths
of a studious retirement. But he presently found that, in
order to secure his end, he must needs do as his father
had done before him. He must leave England, either for
Italy or for France. When his mind was made up to
exile, it was also made up to the relinquishment of his
name. William <span class='sc'>Courten</span> became, even to his nearest
relatives, ‘William <span class='sc'>Charleton</span>.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The friendships he had already formed at Montpelier, in
his youth, and the local charms of that city for a studious
man, incited him to revisit his old retreat. But he made
no permanent abode there. He took long tours, in France,
in Germany, and in Italy; adding everywhere both to the
stores of his knowledge and to the presses and cabinets of
his library and museum. It was during his second stay at
Montpelier that he formed his life-long friendships with a
famous Frenchman, Joseph <span class='sc'>Pitton de Tournefort</span>, and
with a more famous Englishman, John <span class='sc'>Locke</span>. Here also
began his acquaintance with Dr. (afterwards Sir) Hans
<span class='sc'>Sloane</span>.</p>

<p class='c035'>It was at <span class='sc'>Sloane’s</span> instance that he made his solitary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>appearance as an author, in the shape of a communication
to the Royal Society, which was laid before them in 1679,
and afterwards printed in the
<i>Philosophical Transactions</i>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Philosoph.
Transact.</i>,
vol. xxvii,
pp. 485, seqq.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
under the title: <i>Experiments and Observations of the Effects
of several sorts of Poisons upon Animals, made at Montpelier</i>.</p>

<p class='c035'>Thirteen or fourteen years were thus passed. And then,
to the natural yearning of an exile, there came the strong
reinforcement of the call of large collections for a settled
abode. There are few claims to fixity of tenure better
grounded than are those of a Museum or a Library.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Return to England.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The return was not easy, but the difficulties were faced.
It is probable that he came back to England in the summer
of 1684. He did not then own one acre of that land of
which his father had inherited so respectable a breadth in
half a dozen counties. He had not long arrived before one
of his nearest friends wrote him a letter, which seemed to
bode ill for his prospects of a peaceable life. ‘The number
of creditors,’ wrote Richard <span class='sc'>Salwey</span> to him, on the 18th
August, 1684, ‘is incredible, for the debts are standing,
and multiplied to children and grandchildren, who, so long
as the parchment and the wax can be preserved, will not
forego their hopes nor attempts. And I fear your late so
public station<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c030'><sup>[44]</sup></a> will daily expose you, and that you will at
every backstairs and turning be pulled by the sleeve and
provoked.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Salwey to ‘Charlton;’ MS. Sloane, 3962, f. 191.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Nor yet do I know of any danger consequent
in any suit that can be commenced, except putting you to
great trouble and like expenses;—and I fear you have not
a superfluous bank to defray the charge.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span><span class='sc'>Courten</span>, however, was not seriously molested. He
established himself in London as the occupant of a large
suite of chambers in Essex Court, Middle Temple. Here
his collections were conveniently arranged, and they had
space to expand.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Establishment of the Courten Museum.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Ere long we find mention of his Museum
as filling ten rooms.</p>

<p class='c029'>Of the cost at which it had been gathered, there are now
no adequate and authenticated materials for forming an
estimate. But in those days the man who himself travelled
on such a quest had a vast advantage over the man—howsoever
better provided with what in the sixteenth century
was called purse-ability—who sent other men to travel in
his stead. In <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> days no dealers explored the
Continent as an ordinary incident of their calling. The
wreck, too, of such a fortune as that of the <span class='sc'>Courtens</span> was
not contemptible.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Courten Papers</i>, in MS. Sloane, 3962; 303.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When living in France (1677–79) our
collector appears to have had an income of about fifteen
hundred pounds a year, accruing from money invested in
mortgages and in annuities.</p>

<p class='c029'>Although his chief collections were of his own gathering,
he had many helpers. Among them was the future inheritor
of his Museum, Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>. In the year 1687,
when about to set out on his voyage to the West Indies,
<span class='sc'>Sloane</span> wrote to him: ‘I design to send you what is curious
from the several islands we land at,—which will be most of
our plantations.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sloane to ‘Charlton;’ <i>Ib.</i>, 308.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The writer was then a young man.
Probably his acquaintance with <span class='sc'>Courten</span> was at that time
of not greater standing than eight or nine years, but he
writes of the obligations <span class='sc'>Courten</span> had then already conferred
upon him: ‘I am extremely obliged to you, beyond
any in the world.’<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ibid.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<p class='c029'>The use this Collector made of his treasures was as liberal
as the zeal with which he had amassed them was indefatigable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>The friend whose correspondence has just been
quoted said, after <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> death, that he was wont to show
his Museum very freely, and to make his stores contribute,
in various ways, ‘to the advancement of the glory of God,
the honour and renown of the country, and the no small
promotion of knowledge and the useful arts.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Many notices are extant—scattered here and there in the
<i>Diaries</i> and among the correspondence of the day—of visits
made to <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> Museum by men who were able to
judge of what they saw. Those notices confirm the general
statement made by <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, and show the comprehensiveness
of the collector’s tastes as well as the geniality of his
character. Two such notices have an especial interest,
which is not lessened by the fact that both of them are
to be found in diaries that are well known. They record
the visits to Essex Court of John <span class='sc'>Evelyn</span>, and of John
<span class='sc'>Thoresby</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Evelyn’s Visit to Courten’s Museum.</span></div>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Evelyn</span> paid his first visit in charming company. It
was made in December, 1686. He thus tells of it in his
journal: ‘I carried the Countess of <span class='sc'>Sunderland</span> to see
the rarities of one Mr. <span class='sc'>Charlton</span>, in the Middle Temple,
who showed us such a collection as I had never seen in all
my travels abroad—either of private gentlemen, or of princes.
It consisted of miniatures, drawings, shells, insects, medals,&#160;... minerals; all being very perfect and rare of their kind;
especially his books of birds, fishes, flowers, and shells,
drawn and miniatured to the life. He told us that one
book stood him in three hundred pounds.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Diary</i>, &amp;c., vol. ii, p. 260. (Edit. of 1854.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It was painted
by that excellent workman whom the late <span class='sc'>Gaston</span>, Duke of
Orleans, employed.<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c030'><sup>[45]</sup></a> This gentleman’s whole collection,
gathered by himself [while] travelling over most parts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>Europe, is estimated at eight thousand pounds. He appeared
to be a modest and obliging person.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Evelyn</span> records two other visits, which he made at subsequent
times. It is obvious that during almost the whole
period which elapsed between <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> return to England
and his death, his museum was a place of frequent and
fashionable resort; notwithstanding the warning which its
owner had received as to the perils of a ‘public station,’
under his peculiar circumstances. To the celebrated diarist
himself, his visits seem to have suggested a very natural
thought of the public value of such an institution, to be
maintained by and for the country at large. And he was
very far from keeping the idea to himself. <span class='sc'>Evelyn</span> lived
to a more than ordinary term of years, but not long enough
to see his idea carried into act. He had, however, helped
to prepare the way.</p>

<p class='c029'>His incidental statement about the estimated money value
of the <span class='sc'>Courten</span> Museum does not invalidate a foregoing
remark in this chapter. The estimate can hardly have been
founded upon better ground than mere conjecture. But it
is curious to note the near approach of the guess of 1686
to another guess, on the same small point, made nine years
later.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Thoresby’s</span> visit occurred in May, 1695. He records it
thus: ‘Walked to Mr. <span class='sc'>Charlton’s</span> chambers at the Temple,
who very courteously showed me his Museum, which is perhaps
the most noble collection of natural and artificial
curiosities, of ancient and modern coins and medals, that
any private person in the world enjoys. It is said to have
cost him seven or eight thousand pounds sterling....
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Thoresby, <i>Diary</i>, 1695, May 24, vol. i, p. 299.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
I spent the greatest part of my time amongst the coins;
for though the British and Saxon be not very extraordinary,
yet his [collection of] the silver coins of the Emperors and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>Consuls is very noble. He has also a costly collection of
medals of eminent persons in Church and State, and of
domestic and foreign Reformers. But, before I was half
satisfied, an unfortunate visit from the Countess of <span class='sc'>Pembroke</span>
and other ladies from Court prevented further
queries.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The visits of the ‘ladies from Court’ may not have
seemed quite so unfortunate to the host who had to entertain
them, as to the zealous antiquary whose recondite
questions they broke off. At all events, such visits must
have been to <span class='sc'>Courten</span> like renewed glimpses of the gayer
life of which he had known something in his early days.</p>

<p class='c029'>In learned leisure, and in quiet pleasures such as these,
his life passed gently to its end. He kept up his correspondence
as well with some of the surviving friends of
his youth, as with two or three of the eminent scholars and
naturalists with whom he had made acquaintance during
the travel-years of middle life. Failing to raise his fortunes
to the height of his early hopes, he yet won contentment by
bringing down his desires to the level of his means. He
ceased to trouble himself with claims on the Dutch Republic,
or with pretensions to a proprietorship in the Island of
Barbadoes, or even about his interest in debts contracted
by the Crown of England. He had been able, in spite of
all losses, to open to his contemporaries means of culture
and of mental recreation which, on any like scale, had been
before unknown to them. Only in the most famous cities
of Italy had the like then been seen. And he had the final
satisfaction of making the secured continuance of his Museum
the means of further securing, at the same time, the comfort
and prosperity of some humble friends and dependants whose
faithful attention had helped to solace his own closing years.
Nor had he neglected those consolations which are supreme.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>William <span class='sc'>Courten’s</span> Will was made on his death-bed, in
March, 1702. Having bequeathed certain pecuniary legacies—increased
two days afterwards by codicil—and having
provided for the payment of his debts, he made Dr. Hans
<span class='sc'>Sloane</span> his residuary legatee and sole executor. He forbade
all display at his funeral. He died, at Kensington, on the
26th of March, 1702, wanting two days of the completion
of his sixtieth year.<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c030'><sup>[46]</sup></a> He was buried in Kensington churchyard,
near the south-east door of the church. By his friend
and executor an altar-tomb, carved by Grinling <span class='sc'>Gibbons</span>,
was placed above his remains, with this inscription:—</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>Sir Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> was the seventh and youngest son of
Alexander <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, a Scotchman who had married one of
the daughters of Dr. George <span class='sc'>Hickes</span>, Prebendary of Winchester,
and who had settled in Ireland on receiving the
appointment of receiver-general of the estates of the Lord
<span class='sc'>Claneboy</span>, afterwards Earl of <span class='sc'>Clanricarde</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Life of Sir Hans Sloane.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He was
born at Killileagh, in the county Down, on the 16th of
April, 1660.</p>

<p class='c029'>We learn that almost from earliest youth, Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>
evinced his possession of quick parts and of keen powers of
observation. And he gave early indications of that happy
constitution of mind and will which now and then permits
the union of intellectual ambition and aspiration, with not
a little of prudential shrewdness. A special bias towards
the study of the natural sciences was—as it has often been
in like cases—one of the things that were soonest taken
note of by those about him. Faculties such as these naturally
pointed to medicine as a fitting profession for their
early possessor. His home studies, however, were checked
by a severe illness which threatened his life, and from some
of the effects of which he never quite recovered. But that
illness helped to qualify him for his future profession. If
it took away, for life, the likelihood that the bright promises
of the dawn would be altogether realized in his maturity, it
seems to have strengthened, in an unusual degree, both
the prudential element which already marked his character,
and his predisposition to rely mainly, for the success of his
plans, upon plodding industry. From youth to old age an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>unweariable power of taking pains was his leading characteristic.</p>

<p class='c029'>In his eighteenth year he came to London with the immediate
object of studying chemistry and botany, before
he entered on other studies more distinctively medical.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Early Studies in London</span>;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1677–1682.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He learned chemistry under <span class='sc'>Staphorst</span>,<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c030'><sup>[47]</sup></a> and of
botany he acquired a good deal of knowledge by frequenting,
with much assiduity, the recently founded
Botanical Garden at Chelsea. In the latter pursuit he met
with assistance from the intelligent keeper of the garden,
Mr. <span class='sc'>Watts</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>MS. Corresp.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And ere long he acquired the friendship of
John <span class='sc'>Ray</span>, and of Robert <span class='sc'>Boyle</span>.</p>

<p class='c029'>After six years of steady educational labours, both scientific
and medical, he went to Paris, which possessed in
1683—and long afterwards—facilities for medical education
far superior to any that could then be found in London.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>And in France.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1683–4.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
His companions in the journey were Dr. Tancred <span class='sc'>Robinson</span>
and Dr. <span class='sc'>Wakeley</span>.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Sloane</span> had scarcely got farther into France than the
town of Dieppe, before it was his good fortune to make
the acquaintance of Nicholas <span class='sc'>Lemery</span>, and to find himself
able to communicate to that eminent chemist the results
of some novel experiments.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Eloge</i>, in <i>Mém. de l’Acad. des Sciences</i> (1753); and <i>MS. Correspondence</i>. (B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
They journeyed together from
Dieppe to Paris, and the acquaintance thus casually formed
was productive of good to both of them. The studies
begun in Ireland, and assiduously continued in London,
were now matured in Paris under men of European fame.
And the young botanist who heretofore could profit only
by the infant garden established by the London apothecaries
at Chelsea, and by an occasional botanizing ramble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>into the country, could now expatiate at will in the magnificent
<i>Jardin des Plantes</i> of the King of <span class='sc'>France</span>. In
that botanical university <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, too, had <span class='sc'>Tournefort</span>—four
years his senior—for his frequent companion and
fellow-student.</p>

<p class='c029'>In July, 1683, he took his degree as Doctor of Medicine
in the University of Orange. Thence he went to Montpelier,
where he resided until nearly the end of May, 1684.
After visiting Bordeaux, and some other parts of France,
he returned to Paris. There were few towns, in which he
made any stay, that had not given him some friend or
other, in addition to a valuable accession of knowledge. And
the friendships he had once formed were but rarely lost.</p>

<p class='c029'>Towards the close of 1684 Dr. <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> returned to
England, whither the reputation of his increased acquirements
had preceded him. In January, 1685, he was chosen
a Fellow of the Royal Society, and exactly one year afterwards
he was proposed for election as Assistant-Secretary.
Among the other candidates were Denis <span class='sc'>Papin</span> and Edmund
<span class='sc'>Halley</span>. On the first scrutiny, <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> had ten votes;
<span class='sc'>Halley</span> sixteen. The majority was not enough, but on a
second ballot <span class='sc'>Halley</span> was chosen. Early in 1687 he
became a Fellow of the College of Physicians. He had
thus early laid some foundation for a London practice that
would lead him to social eminence, as well as to fortune.
And for the good gifts of fortune he had a very keen
relish.</p>

<p class='c029'>Loving wealth well, he loved science still better. But
he had already good reason to hope that both might be
won, in company. He had become known to Christopher
<span class='sc'>Monk</span>, second Duke of <span class='sc'>Albemarle</span>, and when that nobleman
received, in 1687, the office of Governor-General of
the West India Colonies, <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> received an invitation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>to sail with him, as the Duke’s physician and as Chief
Physician to the fleet; and he was desired to name his
own conditions, if disposed to accept the appointment.</p>

<p class='c029'>He did not take any long time to think over the offer.
If it presented no very brilliant prospect of monetary
profit, it opened a large field for scientific research.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Voyage to Jamaica.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And,
in the main, the field was new.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1687.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
No Englishman had
ever yet been tempted to take so long a journey in the
interests of science. He knew that he had excellent personal
qualifications for turning to good account the large
opportunities of discovery that such a voyage was sure to
bring. Nor was it less certain that it would bring innumerable
occasions for enlarging his strictly professional
knowledge. And he had on his side the vigour of youth,
as well as its curiosity and its enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c029'>In annexing to his reply the conditions of his acceptance
he wrote thus: ‘If it be thought fit that Dr. <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> go
physician to the West Indian Fleet, the surgeons of all
the ships must be ordered to observe his directions....
He proposes that six hundred pounds, <i>per
annum</i>, shall be paid to him quarterly, with a previous payment
of three hundred pounds, in order to his preparation
for this service; and also that if the Fleet shall be called
home he shall have leave to stay in the West Indies if he
pleases.’ The proposed terms were approved.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Corresp.</i> in MS. Sloane, 4069, ff. 86, 87.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The Doctor
embarked at Portsmouth, in the Duke’s frigate <i>Assistance</i>,
on the 12th of September.</p>

<p class='c029'>His work as a scientific collector began at Madeira.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ibid.</i>, MS. Sloane, 3962, f. 310.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
To
botanize in that pleasant island was an enjoyment all the
more welcome after an unusual share of suffering from seasickness,
in the midst of professional toil. For it was
honourably characteristic of <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> that, under all circumstances
and forms of temptation, medical duties had the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>first place with him. What he achieved for science,
throughout his life, was achieved in the intervals of more
immediate duty.</p>

<p class='c029'>He reached Barbadoes in November. Thence he wrote
to <span class='sc'>Courten</span>: ‘This is indeed a new world in all things.
You may be sure the task I have is already delightful to
me.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sloane to Courten; <i>Ib.</i>, 1687, Nov. 28.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Then he continues: ‘I am heartily sorry that I, being
new landed here, cannot now send [what I have collected
for you] with this letter. What I had at Madeira cannot
be come at. What is here I have not, as yet, gathered.
But you may assure yourself that what these parts of the
West Indies afford is all your own, the best way I can
send them.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The collections begun thus favourably were continued
at the beginning of December in the islands of Nevis, St.
Christopher, and Hispaniola. The fleet reached Port Royal
on the 19th of that month. Jamaica was explored with
ardent enthusiasm and with minutest care. Its animals and
minerals, as well as its plants; its history, as well as its
meteorology, were thoroughly studied.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Medical Cases appended to <i>Voyage to Jamaica</i>; vol. i (1708).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And the medical
skill of the new-comer was put as heartily at the service of
the toil-worn negro as at that of the wealthiest planter, or
of the highest officer of the Crown.</p>

<p class='c029'>But presently <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> himself needed the care and skill
he so willingly bestowed. ‘I had a great fever,’ he says,
‘though those about me called it a little seasoning.’ He
had scarcely recovered before his knowledge of the natural
history of Jamaica was suddenly and unpleasantly increased.</p>

<p class='c029'>‘Ever since the beginning of February,’ I find him
writing to the Lord Chief Justice <span class='sc'>Herbert</span> (who seems to
have been one of the earliest of the many patients who
became also friends): ‘I dread earthquakes more than heat.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>For then we had a very great one. Finding the house to
dance and the cabinets to reel, I looked out of window
to see whether people removed the house (a wooden structure)
or no. Casting my eyes towards an aviary, I saw the
birds in as great concern as myself. Then, another terrible
shake coming, I apprehended what it was, and betook me to
my heels to get clear of the house; but before I got down
stairs it was over. If it had come the day after, it had
frighted us ten times more.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sloane to Lord Chief Justice Herbert; MS. Sloane, 4069, ff. 277, 278.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For the day it happened there
arrived a Spanish sloop from Porto Bello, giving an account
of the destruction of great part of the kingdom of
Peru.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Long before this letter was written the exploring studies
and expedition had been resumed with all the activity of
renewed health, and they were carried on—at every available
interval, as I have said, of pressing medical duty—throughout
the year 1688. That eventful year, during
which the thoughts and anxieties of the mass of his countrymen
were so differently engrossed, was to <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> the
especial seedtime of his study of Nature. All that he was
enabled to effect in that attractive path may now seem very
small and dim, when viewed in the light of subsequent
achievements. But it was great for that day, when, in
England, the path was so newly opened that the possession
of a taste for collecting insects was thought, by able men
of the world, to be a strong presumption of lunacy. And
it soon fired the ambition of a multitude of inquirers who
rapidly carried the good work of investigation onward, in
all directions.</p>

<p class='c029'>Towards the close of the year, the Duke of <span class='sc'>Albemarle</span>
suddenly died. The contingency for which <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> had
had the foresight to make provision had arisen, but in a
quite unexpected way; so that his forecast failed to secure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>him that time for continued research which he had coveted
and contracted for. The Duchess of <span class='sc'>Albemarle</span> had
accompanied her husband in his voyage, and, after the
first shock of his death had been borne, was naturally
desirous to leave the colony. <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> could not allow her
to take the return voyage without his attendance. He
hastened to gather up his collections and prepared to come
home. The fleet set sail from Port Royal on the 16th of
March, 1689.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Return Voyage of 1689.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The voyage was full of anxiety. Such news from
England as had yet reached the West Indies was very
fragmentary. And the lack of authentic intelligence about
the outbreak of the Revolution and its results, had been
eked-out by all sorts of wild rumours. The voyagers
looked daily with intense eagerness for outward-bound
ships that might bring them news, and were especially
anxious to know if war had broken out between England
and France. When they caught sight of a sail so wistfully
watched for, they commonly observed in the other
vessel as great a desire to avoid a meeting, as there was
amongst themselves to ensure one.</p>

<p class='c029'>The Duchess of <span class='sc'>Albemarle</span> had with her a large amount
of wealth in plate and jewels, as well as a large retinue.
Her anxieties were not lessened when the captain of the
frigate said to her Grace, two or three weeks after the
departure from Port Royal: ‘I cannot fight any ship having
King <span class='sc'>James’</span> commission, from whom I received mine.’ On
hearing this assurance—which seemed to open to her the
prospect, or at least the possible contingency, of being
carried into France—the Duchess resolved to change her
ship. With <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> and with her suite she left the <i>Assistance</i>,
and re-embarked, first in the late Duke’s yacht, and
then in one of the larger ships of the fleet.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>After this separation, ‘our Admiral’ says <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, ‘pretended
he wanted water and must make the best of his
way for England, without staying to convoy us home,
which accordingly he did.’ The voyage, nevertheless, was
made in safety.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Voyage to Jamaica</i>, &amp;c., vol. ii, p. 344.</div>

<p class='c029'>They learned very little of what had happened at home,
until they had arrived within a few leagues of Plymouth.
Then <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> himself went out, in an armed boat, with
the intention of picking up such news as could be gathered
from any fishermen who might be met with near the coast.
The first fishing vessel they hailed did her best to run away,
but was caught in the pursuit.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ibid.</i>, p. 347.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
To the question, ‘How is
the King?’ the master’s reply was, ‘What King do you
mean? King <span class='sc'>William</span> is well at Whitehall.
King <span class='sc'>James</span>
is in France.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Early Years in England.</span></div>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Sloane</span> landed at Plymouth on the 29th of May, with
large collections in all branches of natural history, and with
improved prospects of fortune. The Duchess of <span class='sc'>Albemarle</span>
behaved to him with great liberality, and for some years to
come he continued to be her domestic physician, and lived, for
the most part, in one or other of her houses as his usual place
of residence. In 1690 much of his correspondence bears date
from the Duchess’ seat at New Hall, in Essex. In 1692
we find him frequently at Albemarle House, in Clerkenwell.
He had also made, whilst in the West Indies, a lucky
investment in the shape of a large purchase of Peruvian
Bark.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Sloane Corresp.</i>, in MSS. Sloane.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It was already a lucrative article of commerce, and
the provident importer had excellent professional opportunities
of adding to its commercial value by making its intrinsic
merits more widely known in England.</p>

<p class='c029'>The botanists, more especially, were delighted with the
large accessions to previous knowledge which <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> had
brought back with him. ‘When I first saw,’ said John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span><span class='sc'>Ray</span>, ‘his stock of dried plants collected in Jamaica, and
in some of the Caribbee Islands, I was much astonished
at the number of the capillary kind, not thinking there had
been so many to be found in both the Indies.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The collector, himself, had presently his surprise in the
matter, but it was of a less agreeable kind. ‘My collection,’
he says, ‘of dried samples of some very strange plants
excited the curiosity of people who loved things of that
nature to see them, and who were welcome, until I observed
some so very curious as to desire to carry part of them
privately home, and injure what they left. This made me
upon my guard.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1693.</div>

<p class='c029'>On the 30th of November, 1693, <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> was elected to
the Secretaryship of the Royal Society. A year afterwards
he was made Physician to Christ Hospital. It is eminently
to his honour that from his first entrance into this office—which
he held for thirty-six years—he applied the whole of
its emoluments for the advantage and advancement of deserving
boys who were receiving their education there. For
that particular appointment he was himself none the richer,
save in contentment and good works.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Catalogue of West Indian Plants, and the Controversy with Plukenet.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>In 1696 he made his first appearance as an author by
the publication of his <i>Catalogus Plantarum quæ in insula
Jamaica sponte proveniunt, vel vulgo coluntur cum earundem
synonimis et locis natalibus: Adjectis aliis quibusdam quæ in
insulis Madeira, Barbadoes, Nevis, et Sancti Christophori
nascuntur</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1696.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He had already seen far too much of the world
to marvel that his book soon brought him censure as well
as praise. By Leonard <span class='sc'>Plukenet</span>, a botanist of great
acquirements and ability, many portions of the Jamaica
Catalogue were attacked, sometimes on well-grounded objections;
more often upon exceptions rather captious than
just, and with that bitterness of expression which is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>unfailing finger-post of envy. <span class='sc'>Plukenet’s</span> strictures were
published in his <i>Almagesti Botanici Mantissa</i>.<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c030'><sup>[48]</sup></a> <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>
made no rash haste to answer his critic. Where the
censure bore correction of real error or oversight, he carefully
profited by it. Where it was the mere cloak of malice,
he awaited without complaint the appropriate time for
dealing, both with censure and censor, which would be
sure to come when he should give to the world the ripened
results of the voyage of 1687.</p>

<p class='c029'>A passage in Dr. <span class='sc'>Sloane’s</span> correspondence with Dr.
<span class='sc'>Charlett</span>, of Cambridge, written in the same year with
the publication of the Jamaica Catalogue, shows that even
whilst he was still almost at the threshold of his London
life, he was able steadily to enlarge his museum.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Charlett to Sloane, in MS. Corresp., 4043, f. 193.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
At that
early date, <span class='sc'>Charlett</span>, who had seen it during a visit to
London, calls it already ‘a noble collection of all natural
curiosities.’<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c030'><sup>[49]</sup></a> The collector, when he landed its first fruits
at Plymouth, had yet before him—such was to be his unusual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>length of days—almost sixty-four years of life. Not
one of them, probably, passed without some valuable accession
to his museum. And those sixty-four years were the
adolescent and formative years of the study of the Physical
Sciences in Britain. They were years, too, in the course
of which there was to be a great development of British
energy, both in foreign travel and in colonial enterprise.
Very many were to run to and fro in the earth, so that
knowledge might be largely increased. As a traveller,
<span class='sc'>Sloane</span> had already done his spell of work. But just
as that was achieved, he was placed, by his election to
the secretaryship to the Royal Society, precisely in the
position where he could most extensively profit by a
wide correspondence with men of like scientific pursuits
all over the world, and could exercise a watchful
observation over the doings and the opportunities of
explorers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Resumption of the ‘Philosophical Transactions.’</span></div>

<p class='c029'>But the most immediate result of his secretaryship was
the resumption of the suspended <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>.
The interruption of a work which had already rendered
yeoman service to Science, abroad as well as at home, had
been caused by a combination of unfavourable circumstances.
The death of its first and energetic editor, Henry
<span class='sc'>Oldenburg</span>; some diminution in the Society’s income;
and some personal disagreements at its Council board, seem
all, in their measure, to have concurred to impede a publication,
the continuance of which the best men in the
Royal Society knew to be inseparable from the achievement
of its true purposes. <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> bestirred himself with the
steady vigour which had been born with him; impressed
his friends into the service; profited by the foreign connections
he had formed ten years earlier at Paris, Bordeaux,
and Montpelier, and so found new channels by which to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>enrich the pages of the <i>Transactions</i>, as well as to extend
their circulation.</p>

<p class='c029'>He did it, of course, in his own way, and under the
necessary influence of his habits and predispositions. One
natural result of his labours, as secretary and as editor, was
a frequent prominence of medical subjects, both at the
meetings and in the subsequent selections for permanent
record. If such a prominence might now and then give,
or seem to give, fair ground of complaint to men whose
thoughts were absorbed in the calculus of fluxions, or
whose eyes were wont to search the heavens that they
might learn the courses of the stars, it had at least the excuse
that it tended to the elevation—in all senses of the
word—of a profession in the thorough education and the
dignified status of which all the world have a deep interest.</p>

<p class='c029'>If <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, in his day, occasionally made scientific men
somewhat more familiar with medical themes than they
cared to be, he did very much to make medical men aware
of the peculiar duty under which their profession laid them
of becoming also men of true science. And in this way he
exerted an influence upon medical knowledge, which was
none the less pregnant with good and enduring results
because it was in great measure an indirect influence. It
was one of the minor, but memorable, results of the establishment
of the Royal Society that it tended powerfully to
lift medical practice out of the slough of quackery.</p>

<p class='c029'>This frequent reading of medical papers during the
Doctor’s secretaryship could not fail to give an opening,
now and again, for the wit of the scorner. A physician,
in his daily practice, is constantly seeing the power of small
things. He may well, at times, over estimate trifles. In
the year 1700, Dr. <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> was made the subject of a
satirical pamphlet which appeared under the title of ‘<i>The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Transactioneer, with some of his Philosophical Fancies</i>.’
The author of the satire was Dr. William <span class='sc'>King</span>, but, for a
considerable time, the authorship was unknown. There
was great anxiety to discover it, not only on <span class='sc'>Sloane’s</span>
part individually, but on the part of the Council at large.
The whole affair was trivial, and would be unworthy of
memory but that it led to some dissensions within the
Society itself, which for a long time left marks of their
influence.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Sloane and Woodward.</span></div>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Sloane</span> conceived that <i>The Transactioneer</i> was the production
of Dr. John <span class='sc'>Woodward</span>—the author of <i>Natural
History of the Earth</i>—who was himself a member of the
Royal Society’s Council. <span class='sc'>Woodward</span>, in denying the
imputation, endorsed the satire. ‘Whether there was not
some occasion given,’ he said to the Council, ‘may be
worth your consideration. This I am sure of: The world
has been now, for some time past, very loud upon that
subject.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Newton Correspondence and Papers</i>; cited by Brewster, in <i>Memoirs</i>, &amp;c. (2nd Edit.), vol. ii, ff. 185, 186.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And there were those who laid the charges so
much wrong, that I have but too often had occasion to vindicate
the Society itself, and that in public company.’ The
ill feeling thus excited lasted a long time. It seemed at
length, that the Society must lose either the services of its
laborious Secretary or those of his active-tongued opponent.</p>

<p class='c029'>The petty dissension came to a height when <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>
chanced to make some passing medical comment on the
words ‘the bezoar is a gall-stone,’ occurring in a paper
which he was reading to the Society, from the Memoirs of
the Parisian Academy of Sciences. <span class='sc'>Sloane’s</span> casual remark
drew from <span class='sc'>Woodward</span> the offensive words, ‘No man
who understands anatomy would make such an assertion.’
On another occasion he interrupted some observation or
other made by <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, by exclaiming—‘Speak sense, or
English, and we shall understand you.’ A friend or two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>of <span class='sc'>Woodward</span> tried hard to back him by enlisting the
illustrious President on their side. They reminded <span class='sc'>Newton</span>
that he had been often himself impatient under the
medical dissertations, and they praised Dr. <span class='sc'>Woodward’s</span>
acquirements in philosophy. ‘For a seat in the Council,’
replied Sir Isaac, ‘a man should be a moral philosopher,
as well as a natural one.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Records of the Royal Society.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Eventually, it was resolved:
‘That Dr. <span class='sc'>Woodward</span> be removed from the Council, for
creating a disturbance by the said reflecting words upon
Dr. <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>.’ The latter was of a very forgiving temper,
and he soon sought to be reconciled with his adversary.</p>

<p class='c029'>His professional course, meanwhile, was steadily upward.
A friendship which he had contracted in 1705 with Dr.
<span class='sc'>Sydenham</span> greatly aided his progress. <span class='sc'>Sydenham</span> was
retiring from practice, and gave to <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> his cordial
recommendations. In 1712<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c030'><sup>[50]</sup></a> he was made Physician
Extraordinary to the Queen, whom he attended, two years
afterwards, on her death bed. He filled the office of
Physician-in-Chief to <span class='sc'>George the First</span>, by whom, on
the 3rd April, 1716, he was created a Baronet. He was,
I believe, the first physician who received that dignity. In
1719 he became President of the College of Physicians. In
1727 he received the crowning honour of a life which, to
an unusual degree, had already been replete with honourable
distinctions of almost every kind. He was placed in
the chair of the Royal Society, as the next successor of
<span class='sc'>Newton</span>.</p>

<p class='c029'>Eighteen years before, he had been welcomed into the
illustrious Academy of Sciences, the establishment of which
at Paris had followed so quickly upon the foundation of the
Royal Society. Both academies had worked with conspicuous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>success. Both had been adorned by a long line
of eminent members. They had frequently, and in many
ways, interchanged friendly communion. To <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> himself,
the reception at Paris had been the prelude of many
like invitations from other learned societies in various parts
of Europe. No man of his time had a worthier estimate of
the dignity involved in the freemasonry of science, nor had
any a more conscientious sense of the duties and responsibilities
which it entails.</p>

<p class='c029'>As President of the Royal Society, one of his earliest proposals
to the Council was that, for the future, no pecuniary
contribution should be received from foreign members
whose fellowship it invited as an honour. He urged this
step, notwithstanding that the Society was at the time in
debt from an unusual arrear of subscriptions,—an arrear so
great that he felt it to be right that the Council should be
recommended to sue their offending brethren in the law
courts. His third proposal, like both the others, had for
its object the incontestible advantage and honour of the
Society. He checked some nascent abuses in elections by
making it necessary that there should be an express approval
of every new candidate by the Council, on the recommendation
of not less than three fellows, before proceeding
to a ballot in the Society at large.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Natural History of Jamaica.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The work by which <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> holds his chief place in the
literature of science, the <i>Natural History of Jamaica</i>, was
the work of no less than thirty-eight years. Its materials,
as we have seen, were collected in the years 1687 and
1688. The first volume was not published until 1708.
Seventeen additional years elapsed before the completion
of the second. The fact indicates how crowded with avocations
its author’s life was, as well as the marked conscientiousness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>and thoroughness which from youth to age
characterized his doings.</p>

<p class='c029'>The Jamaica book cannot be opened without some appreciation,
even at first sight, of this faculty of thoroughness.
For it is shown not more by the elaboration and beauty of
the illustrations, than by the copious citation of authorities,
on all points in relation to which authority is valuable.
That all previous labourers in his field should have their
full meed of acknowledgment is with <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> a prime
anxiety.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Sloane’s services to Arboriculture.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The West Indian Voyage of 1687–89 had had, it may
here be remarked, other results besides that of exciting new
emulation—at home and abroad—in the study of natural
history, and in the amassing in cabinets and presses of the
dried and preserved objects of that study. It gave a
marked impulse to arboriculture, both in England and in
Ireland. What <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> had to show, and to tell of, led to
the sending oversea of vessels expressly prepared for the
transport of living trees; and several noble ornaments of
our parks and pleasure grounds date their introduction to
English and Irish soil from the expeditions so set on foot.</p>

<p class='c035'>The <i>Natural History of Jamaica</i> excited considerable
interest abroad, as well as at home.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Corresp. of Sloane and Briasson; in MS. Sloane, 4039, ff. 136–140.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Bernard de <span class='sc'>Jussieu</span>
offered to undertake the editorship of a French translation,
and <span class='sc'>Briasson</span>, a Parisian bookseller of some eminence,
wrote to <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> that he was willing to incur the charges
and risk of publication, on condition that the author would
send the copper plates of the original work to Paris, for
use in the new edition. Sir Hans, however, objected to
incur the risk of this transmission across the channel, but
was willing to have the needful impression worked off in
London; an arrangement to which the Parisian, in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>turn, was disinclined to assent, being of opinion—perhaps
not unjustly—that, in 1743, the art of copperplate printing
was better understood in Paris than in London. On
these grounds the negotiation was broken off.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Growth of the Sloane Museum.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Amidst these varied avocations, the growth of the library
and museum went on unceasingly. Friends and foes contributed,
in turn, to its enrichment. The year 1702 saw
the incorporation with the original gatherings of the West
India voyage of the splendid collections of <span class='sc'>Courten</span>, the
friend of <span class='sc'>Sloane’s</span> youth. In 1710, Sir Hans acquired
the valuable herbaria of his old assailant, Leonard <span class='sc'>Plukenet</span>.
In 1718 he purchased the extensive collections, in all departments
of natural history, of another friend of early
years, James <span class='sc'>Petiver</span>. The herbarium of Adam <span class='sc'>Buddle</span>,
a botanist little remembered now but of note in his generation,
came to <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, as a token of friendship, from the
death-bed of its collector.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MS. Sloane, 4069, <i>passim</i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The scientific possessions of
Dr. Christopher <span class='sc'>Merret</span> were purchased from his son, and
from time to time, when valuable collections were known to
be on sale upon the Continent, agents went across to buy.</p>

<p class='c035'>Of these numerous sources of augmentation the museum
of <span class='sc'>Petiver</span> was next in importance to that of <span class='sc'>Courten</span>—but
with a considerable interval. It is said (in the contemporary
correspondence, as I think) that its cost to
<span class='sc'>Sloane</span> was four thousand pounds. But remembering
what four thousand pounds was a hundred and fifty years
ago, there is reason to suspect some exaggeration in the
statement.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Natural History Collections of Petiver.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>James <span class='sc'>Petiver</span>, when Sir Hans first became acquainted
with him, was serving, as an apprentice, the then apothecary
of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital. He afterwards became
apothecary to the Charter House. He had, in one way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>or other, made for himself a singularly extensive acquaintance
amongst seafaring men; and by their help had established
an almost world-wide correspondence with people interested
in natural history, or possessed of special opportunities for
gathering its rarities. Of such rarities, <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> somewhere
says, ‘He had procured, I believe, a greater quantity than
any man before him.’ But in course of time his collections
overpowered his means, or his industry, for the work of
preservation and arrangement. When, at the collector’s
death, they passed into the possession of his friend, choice
specimens were found, not in order, but in heaps. The
due classification and ordering occupied many hands during
many months.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Sloane’s Correspondence, and his Charities.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The charities of human life were not, in the breast of Sir
Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, choked either by the various allurements
and preoccupations of science, or by the ceaseless toils of a
busy and anxious profession. He was a very liberal giver,
and also a discriminating and conscientious giver. I have
rarely seen a correspondence which mirrors more strikingly
than does that of <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, a just and equable attention to
multifarious and often conflicting claims.</p>

<p class='c029'>The multiplicity of the claims was, indeed, as notable as
was the patience with which they were listened to. Not to
dwell upon the innumerable gropings after money of which,
in one form or other, every man who attains any sort of
eminence is sure to have his share (but of which Sir Hans
<span class='sc'>Sloane</span> seems to have had a Benjamin’s portion) or upon
interminable requests for the use of influence, at Court, at
the Treasury, at the London Hospitals, at the Council
Boards of the Royal Society or of the College of Physicians,
and elsewhere; his fame brought upon him a mass of
appeals and solicitations from utter strangers, busied with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>less worldly aims and pursuits. Enthusiastic students of
the deep things of theology sought his opinion on abstruse
and mystical doctrines. Advocates of perpetual peace, and
of the transformation, at a breath, of the Europe of the
eighteenth century into a new Garden of Eden, implored
him to endorse their theories, or to interpret their dreams.</p>

<p class='c029'>His replies are sometimes both characteristic and amusing;
none the less so for the fact that his power of writing
was, at all times, far beneath his other mental powers and
attainments. Now and then, though rarely, a touch of
humour lights up the homeliness of phrase.</p>

<p class='c029'>To one of the enthusiasts in mystic divinity, who had
sent for his perusal an enormous manuscript, he replied:
‘I am very much obliged for the esteem you have of my
knowledge, which, I am very sure, comes far short of your
opinion.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sloane to Gabriel Nisbett, May, 1737, MS. Sloane, 4069, f. 38.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
As to the particular controversies on foot in relation
to Natural and Revealed Religion, and to Predestination,
I am no ways further concerned than to act as my
own conscience directs me in those matters; and am no
judge for other people.... I have not time to peruse the
book you sent.’</p>

<p class='c029'>To the worthy and once famous Abbé <span class='sc'>de Saint Pierre</span>,
who would fain have established with <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> a steady
correspondence on the universal amelioration of mankind,
by means of a vast series of measures, juridical, political,
and politico-economical, which started from the total abolition
of vice and of war, and descended to the improvement
of road-making by some happy anticipation—a hundred
years in advance—of our own <span class='sc'>Macadam</span>, he wrote thus:
‘I should be very glad to see a general Peace established,
for ever.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sloane to St. Pierre, MS. Sloane, 4069, f. 44.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Rumours of war are often, indeed, found to be
baseless, and the fears of it, even when well grounded, are
often dissipated by an unlooked-for Providence. But poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>mortals are often so weak as to suffer, in their health, from
the fear of danger, where there is none!’</p>

<p class='c029'>Letters on high themes like these had their frequent
variety, in the shape of proffers of contributions, to be made
upon terms, for the enlargement of the Museum, the fame of
which had now spread into very humble ranks of society. A
single specimen in this kind will suffice: ‘I understand,’
wrote a correspondent of a speculative turn, ‘you are a
great virtuoso, and gives a valuable consideration for novelties
of antiquity,’—on getting thus far in the perusal, one
can imagine Sir Hans murmuring ‘not willingly, I assure
you,’—‘a pin has been many hundred years in our family,
and was, I am told, the pin of the first Saxon king of the
West Angles,’ and so on.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Acquisition of the Manor of Chelsea.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Until the year 1741, a few months after his resignation
of the chair of the Royal Society on the score of old age,
Sir Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> continued to live chiefly in London;
though often removing, for part of the summer months, to
his Manor House in the then charming suburb of Chelsea.
He had purchased that valuable manor, from the family
of Cheyne, in 1714. The fine old House abounded in
historical recollections and amongst them, as most readers
will remember, in associations connected with the memory
of Sir Thomas <span class='sc'>More</span>. It had the additional attraction of
a large and beautiful garden, close to that other garden in
which the now Lord of the Manor had pursued, with all
the energies of youth, the study of botany. One of his
earliest acts of lordship had been a graceful gift to the
Company of Apothecaries, of the freehold in the land of
which till then they had been tenants. In 1741 he transferred
his Museum and Library from Bloomsbury to Chelsea.
His former house—situated in Great Russell Street,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>near the corner of what is now Bloomsbury Square—had
been capacious, but the new one admitted of a greatly
improved arrangement and display of the collections.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>A Royal Visit to the Sloane Museum at Chelsea.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The state and character of the Sloane Museum, in the
fullness to which the collector had brought it during these
latest years of his life, can scarcely be exemplified better
than in a contemporary account of a visit which was paid
to the Manor House at Chelsea by the Prince and Princess
of Wales, in the year 1748. I quote it, almost verbally,
from the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i> of that year, but with some
unimportant omissions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>G. M., vol. xviii, pp. 301, 302. (July, 1748.)</div>

<p class='c029'>At that date, the Manor House formed a square of above
a hundred feet on each side, enclosing a court. Three of
the principal rooms were, on the occasion of this royal visit,
filled successively—as the visitors passed from one room
into another—with the finest portions of the collections in
its most portable departments. The minerals were first
shown. The tables were spread with drawers filled with
all sorts of precious stones in their natural beds, as they are
found in the earth, except the first table, which contained
stones found in animals, such as pearls, bezoars, and the
like. Emeralds, topazes, amethysts, sapphires, garnets,
rubies, diamonds,&#160;... with magnificent vessels of cornelian,
onyx, sardonyx and jasper, delighted the eye, says
the attendant describer, and raised the mind to praise the
great Creator of all things.</p>

<p class='c029'>When their Royal Highnesses, continues our narrator,
had viewed one room, and went into another, the scene
was shifted. When they returned, the same tables were
covered, for a second course, with all sorts of jewels,
polished and set after the modern fashion, and with gems
carved and engraved. For the third course, the tables were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>spread with gold and silver ores, and with the most precious
and remarkable ores used in the dresses of men from
Siberia to the Cape of Good Hope, from Japan to Peru;
and with both ancient and modern coins in gold and silver.</p>

<p class='c029'>The gallery, a hundred and ten feet in length, presented
a ‘surprising prospect.’ The most beautiful corals, crystals,
and figured stones; the most brilliant insects; shells,
painted with as great variety as the precious stones; and
birds vying with the gems; diversified with remains of the
antediluvian world.</p>

<p class='c029'>Then a noble vista presented itself through several rooms
filled with books; among these were many hundred volumes
of dried plants; a room, full of choice and valuable manuscripts;
and the rich present sent by the French King to
Sir Hans of the engravings of his collections of paintings,
medals, and statues, and of his Palaces, in twenty-five
large atlas volumes.</p>

<p class='c029'>Below stairs, some rooms were then shown, filled with
the antiquities of Egypt, Greece, Etruria, Rome, Britain,
and even America; other rooms and the Great Saloon
were filled with preserved animals. The halls were decorated
with the horns of divers creatures.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>G. M., vol. xviii, pp. 301, 302. (July, 1748.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘Fifty volumes
in folio,’ concludes the enthusiastic bystander who chronicled,
for Mr. Sylvanus <span class='sc'>Urban</span>, the royal visit of 1748,
‘would scarce suffice to contain a detail of this immense
Museum, consisting of above 200,000 articles.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The Prince of <span class='sc'>Wales</span>, on taking leave of his host, gave
expression to a wish which he did not live long enough
to see realised. ‘It is a great pleasure to me,’ he said,
‘to see so magnificent a collection in England. It is an
ornament to the Nation. Great honour would redound
from the establishing of it for public use, to the latest
posterity.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>Plans, more or less definite, of perpetuating those collections
for public use had occasionally engaged their owner’s
thoughts almost from the date of his acquisition of the
Museum of William <span class='sc'>Courten</span>, in 1702.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Will and Codicils of 1749–51.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In 1707, he had
watched with interest a scheme that had been set on foot
for the formation of a Public Library in London by combining
the old Royal Collection with the collections of Sir
Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> and of the Royal Society.<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c030'><sup>[51]</sup></a> But that scheme
failed of execution, until, almost half a century later, it was,
in the main, revived and carried out as the indirect but
very natural consequence of his own testamentary dispositions.</p>

<p class='c029'>His Will, in its first form, was made at Chelsea in 1748,
but was replaced on the 10th July, 1749, by the following
codicil:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The testamentary disposal of the Courten and Sloane Museum.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>‘Whereas I have in and by my said Will given some
directions about the sale and disposition of my Museum, or
collection of rarities herein more particularly mentioned,
now I do hereby revoke my said Will, as far as relates
thereto, and I do direct and appoint concerning the same in
the following manner: Having had from my youth a strong
inclination to the study of plants and all other productions
of nature, and having through the course of many years,
with great labour and expense, gathered together whatever
could be procured either in our own or foreign countries
that was rare and curious; and being fully convinced that
nothing tends more to raise our ideas of the power, wisdom,
goodness, providence, and other perfections of the Deity,
or more to the comfort and well being of his creatures,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>than the enlargement of our knowledge of the works of
nature, I do will and desire that for the promoting of these
noble ends, the glory of God, and the good of man, my
collection in all its branches may be, if possible, kept and
preserved together whole and entire, in my Manor House
in the Parish of Chelsea, situate near the Physic Garden
given by me to the Company of Apothecaries for the same
purposes; and having great reliance that the right honourable,
honourable, and other persons hereafter named, will
be influenced by the same principles and [will] faithfully
and conscientiously discharge the trust hereby reposed in
them, I do give, devise, and bequeath, unto the Rt. Hon.
Charles Sloane <span class='sc'>Cadogan</span>&#160;... [<i>and to forty-nine other
persons whose names follow</i>,] all that my Collection or
Museum at, in, or about, my Manor House at Chelsea
aforesaid, which consists of too great a variety to be particularly
described, but&#160;... which are more particularly
described, mentioned, and numbered, with short histories
or accounts of them, with proper references, in certain
catalogues by me made, containing thirty-eight volumes in
folio, and eight volumes in quarto,—except such framed
pictures as are not marked with the word “<i>Collection</i>”—to
have and to hold to them and their successors and assigns
for ever,&#160;... upon the trusts, and for the uses and
purposes,&#160;... hereafter particularly specified concerning
the same.</p>

<p class='c029'>‘And for rendering this my intention more effectual that
the said Collection may be preserved and continued entire
in its utmost perfection and regularity, and being assured
that nothing will conduce more to this than placing the
same under the direction and care of learned, experienced,
and judicious persons who are above all low and mean
views, I do earnestly desire that the King, H.R.H. the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>Prince of <span class='sc'>Wales</span>, H.R.H. William, Duke of <span class='sc'>Cumberland</span>,
the Archbishop of <span class='sc'>Canterbury</span> for the time being&#160;...
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Authentic Copies</i>, &amp;c. (B. M.) 17, p. 12.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
[<i>and twenty-eight others, being chiefly great Officers of
State</i>] will condescend so far as to act and be Visitors of
my said Museum and Collection; and I do hereby, with
their leave, nominate and appoint them Visitors thereof,
with full power and authority for any five or more of them
to enter my said Collection or Museum, at any time or
times, to peruse, supervise, and examine, the same, and the
management thereof, and to visit, correct, and reform,
from time to time, as there may be occasion, either jointly
with the said Trustees or separately—upon application to
them for that purpose, or otherwise—all abuses, defects,
neglects or mismanagements, that may happen to arise
therein, or touching and concerning the person or persons,
officer or officers, that are or shall be appointed to attend
the same.</p>

<p class='c029'>‘And my will is and I do hereby request and desire that
the said Trustees, or any seven or more of them, do make
their humble application to His Majesty, or to Parliament
at the next session after my decease,—as shall be thought
most proper,—in order to pay the full and clear sum of
twenty thousand pounds unto my executors or to the
survivors of them, in consideration of the said Collection or
Museum; it not being, as I apprehend or believe, a fourth
of their real and intrinsic value; and also to obtain such
effectual powers and authorities for vesting in the said
Trustees all and every part of my said Collection,&#160;... and
also my said capital Manor-House, with such gardens and
outhouses as shall thereunto belong and be used by me at
the time of my decease, in which it is my desire that the
same shall be kept and preserved; and also the water of or
belonging to my Manor of Chelsea coming from Kensington,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>or right of patronage of the Church of Chelsea; to the end
the same premises may be absolutely vested in the said
Trustees for the preserving and continuing my said Museum
in such manner as they shall think most likely to answer
the public benefit by me intended, and also obtain, as
aforesaid, a sufficient fund and provision for maintaining
and supporting my said Manor House,&#160;... to be vested in
the said Trustees for ever....
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Authentic Copies</i>, &amp;c. (B. M.) 17, p. 12.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And it is also my will and
desire that all such other powers&#160;... may be added or vested
as well in the said intended Trustees as in the Visitors
hereby appointed, as shall by the Legislature be thought
most proper and convenient for the better management,
order, and care, of my said Collection and premises.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Provision is then made, in subsequent clauses of this
codicil, for the replacement, by the Trustees surviving, from
time to time, of vacancies occasioned by death in the ranks
of the Trustees first appointed; and by surviving Visitors
of vacancies so occasioned in those of the original
Visitors.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Later Codicils.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>In September, 1750, another codicil added to the list of
Visitors—in order to supply vacancies which death had
already wrought—the Earls of <span class='sc'>Macclesfield</span> and <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span>,
and the then Master of the Rolls, Sir John <span class='sc'>Strange</span>,
with proviso of succession for the Master of the Rolls of
the time being. Sir John <span class='sc'>Bernard</span>, Sir William <span class='sc'>Calvert</span>,
and Mr. Slingsby <span class='sc'>Bethel</span> were, in like manner, added to
the roll of Trustees. The same codicil excepted the advowson
of the Rectory of Chelsea from the bequest of 1749,
and annexed it to the lordship of the Manor.</p>

<p class='c029'>By his marriage with the daughter and heiress of Mr.
<span class='sc'>Langley</span>, an Alderman of London, Sir Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>
had issue two daughters, but no son. The elder of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>daughters, Sarah <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, married George <span class='sc'>Stanley</span>, of
Poultons, in Hampshire; the younger, Elizabeth, married
Lord <span class='sc'>Cadogan</span>. By the representatives of those co-heiresses
the large inheritance was eventually enjoyed.</p>

<p class='c029'>A subsequent codicil of 1751, added nine other Trustees,
five of whom were distinguished foreigners. Among the
four English names are those of John <span class='sc'>Hampden</span> (‘twenty-fourth
hereditary lord of Great Hampden,’ and last lineal
male descendant of that famous stock) and William
<span class='sc'>Sotheby</span>.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Closing Years.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The declining years of a man to whom had been given,
not only unusual length of days, but an unusual span both
of bodily and of mental vigour, so that he remained in the
rank of busy men until he had passed his eightieth year,
were necessarily days of seclusion. He had enjoyed not
only the honours<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c030'><sup>[52]</sup></a> and the comforts, but the troop of
friends which should accompany old age. Yet a man who
reaches the age of ninety-two must needs lose the friends
of his maturity, as well as the friends of his youth. Sir
Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, in the old Manor House of Chelsea, had
something of the experience which made a famous statesman
of our own day, who was loth to leave the stir of
London life, say—with a sigh—‘I see all the world passing
my windows, but few come in.’</p>

<p class='c029'>His chief recreations, in those latest years, lay in the
continued examination of the stores of nature and of art
which never palled upon his capacity of enjoyment, and in
the regular weekly visit of a much younger man, who was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>very conversant in the busy world without; who could talk,
and talk well, alike upon public events, upon the novelties
of science, and upon the gossip of the coffee-houses and the
clubs. This friend of old age was George <span class='sc'>Edwards</span>, a
naturalist of considerable acquirements, and the author of
some <i>Essays on Natural History</i> which are still worth
reading.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Sloane’s</span> mental vigour long outlived his power of bodily
locomotion. For years he could move from room to room,
or on very bright days from room to garden, only by the
aid of an invalid chair. In other respects, his health gave
a weighty sanction to the counsel which he had been wont
to give, not infrequently, in lieu of an invited but superfluous
prescription. ‘I advise you’ he would say, ‘to what
I practice myself. I never take physic when I am well.
When I am ill, I take little, and only such as has been very
well tried.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The end of a bright, abundant, and most useful life, came
at the beginning of the year 1753. On the tenth of January,
George <span class='sc'>Edwards</span> found him rapidly sinking, and suffering
greatly. On the eleventh he found him at the point of death.
‘I continued with him,’ he wrote, ‘later than any one of
his relatives. But I was obliged to retire—his last agonies
being beyond what I could bear; although, under his pain
and weakness of body, he seemed to retain a great firmness
of mind and resignation to the will of God.’ He was buried
at Chelsea, in the same vault in which, twenty-eight years
before, he had buried his wife.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Synoptical Tables of the Sloane Museum.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>This indefatigable collector had continued to enrich his
Museum with new accessions as long as he lived. We have
the means of estimating its growth—as regards mere numbers,
of course—by comparing a synoptical table drawn up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>in 1725—for the purpose of showing to certain grumblers
what had been the nature and aim of those avocations which
had delayed the completion of the <i>Natural History of
Jamaica</i>—with another table drawn up by his Trustees immediately
after his death.</p>

<p class='c029'>The comparison of numbers shows that the twenty thousand
two hundred and twenty-eight coins and medals of
1725 had grown, in 1752, to thirty-two thousand. Other
antiquities had increased from eight hundred and twenty-four
to two thousand six hundred and thirty-five. The
minerals and fossils had increased from about three thousand
to five thousand eight hundred and twenty-two specimens.
The botanical collection which, in 1725, had
numbered eight thousand two hundred and twenty-six
specimens, together with a <i>Hortus Siccus</i> of two hundred
volumes, had become in 1752 twelve thousand five hundred
specimens, with a <i>Hortus Siccus</i> of three hundred and thirty-four
volumes. The other natural history collections had
increased on the average by more than one half. The
details are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c029'>On the 27th January—sixteen days after Sir Hans’ death—about
forty of the Trustees named in the Will met at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>Chelsea, to confer with the Executors. Lord <span class='sc'>Cadogan</span> produced
the Will and its Codicils. By these, should the
bequest and its additions be accepted, the manor house and
land, together with the collection in its existing state
and arrangement, would be given to the Public. This, said
Lord <span class='sc'>Cadogan</span>, will save the hazard and expense of removal.
Mr. William <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> then informed the Trustees
that the Executors had thought it prudent temporarily to
remove the medals of gold and silver, the precious stones,
gems, and vases, to the Bank of England, in order to ensure
their present safety.</p>

<p class='c029'>The Earl of <span class='sc'>Macclesfield</span> was then placed in the chair.
A synopsis of the contents of the Museum was read by Mr.
James <span class='sc'>Empson</span>, who had acted as its curator for many years.
Mr. <span class='sc'>Empson</span> was appointed to act as Secretary to the
Trustees, and a form of Memorial to be addressed to the
King, in order to the carrying out of the trusts of the Will,
was agreed upon.</p>

<p class='c029'>The Memorial had—eventually—the desired effect.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Act for Establishing the British Museum.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It
led, in the course of the year 1753, to the passing of an Act of
Parliament—26 <span class='sc'>George II</span>, chapter 22—which is entitled
<i>An Act for the purchase of the</i> Museum or Collection of Sir
Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, <i>and of the</i> Harleian Collection of Manuscripts,
<i>and for providing one General Repository for the better
reception and more convenient use of the said Collections,
and of the</i> Cottonian Library, <i>and of the additions thereto</i>.</p>

<p class='c029'>The Act recites the tenour of the testamentary dispositions
made by Sir Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>. It also recites that a provisional
assent had been given by his Trustees to the removal of his
Museum from the Manor House of Chelsea ‘to any proper
place within the Cities of London and Westminster, or the
suburbs thereof, if such removal shall be judged most advantageous
to the Public.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>The Act then proceeds to declare that, ‘Whereas, all arts
and sciences have a connexion with each other, and discoveries
in natural philosophy and other branches of speculative
knowledge,’ for the advancement whereof the Museum
was intended, may, in many instances, give help to useful
experiments and inventions, ‘therefore, to the end that the
said Museum may be preserved and maintained, not only
for the inspection and entertainment of the learned and the
curious, but for the general use and benefit of the Public,’
it is enacted by Parliament that the sum of twenty thousand
pounds shall be paid to the Executors of Sir Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>,
in full satisfaction for his said Museum.</p>

<p class='c029'>In this Statute, also, the preceding original Act for the
public establishment of the Cottonian Library (12th and
13th of <span class='sc'>William III</span>, c. 7), together with the subsequent
Act on that subject (5th <span class='sc'>Anne</span>, c. 30), are severally recited,
and it is declared as follows:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Further Provisions of the Act of Incorporation.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>First, ‘Although the public faith hath been thus engaged
to provide for the better reception and more convenient use
of the Cottonian Library, a proper repository for that purpose
hath not yet been prepared, for the want of which the
said Library did&#160;... suffer by a fire;’</p>

<p class='c029'>And secondly, ‘Arthur <span class='sc'>Edwards</span>, late of Saint George’s,
Hanover Square, in the county of Middlesex, Esquire, being
desirous to preserve for the public use the said Cottonian
Library, and to prevent the like accident for the future,
bequeathed the sum of seven thousand pounds’—after
the occurrence of a certain contingent event—for the purpose
either of erecting, ‘in a proper situation, such a house
as might be most likely to preserve that Library from all
accidents, or—in the event of the performance by the Public,
before the falling out of the contingency above mentioned,
of that duty to which it already stood pledged by Act of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>Parliament, then—for the purpose of purchasing such manuscripts,
books of antiquities, ancient coins, medals, and
other curiosities, as might be worthy to increase the Cottonian
Library aforesaid;’ to which end the same public
benefactor further bequeathed his own library.</p>

<p class='c029'>In order therefore to give due effect, at length, both to
the primary donation of Sir John <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, and to the additional
benefaction made thereto by Major Arthur <span class='sc'>Edwards</span>,
Parliament now enacted that a general repository should
be provided for the several collections of <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, <span class='sc'>Edwards</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, and that Major <span class='sc'>Edwards’</span> legacy of money
should be paid to the Trustees created by the new Act, in
accordance with the provisions heretofore recited in Sir
Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane’s</span> codicil of 1749.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Services of Mr. Speaker Onslow in the formation of the British Museum.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>It is to the exertions, at this time, of Arthur <span class='sc'>Onslow</span>,
the then Speaker of the House of Commons, that historical
students owe their debt of gratitude for the preservation
of the Harleian Manuscripts from that dispersion,—abroad
as well as at home,—which befel the Harleian
printed books.</p>

<p class='c029'>When the Memorial of <span class='sc'>Sloane’s</span> Trustees was first presented
to <span class='sc'>George the Second</span>, he received it with the
stolid indifference to all matters bearing upon science and
mental culture, which was as saliently characteristic of that
king as were his grosser vices. ‘I don’t think there are
twenty thousand pounds in the Treasury,’ was the remark
with which he dismissed the proposal. Money could be
found, indeed, for very foolish purposes, and for very base
ones. And the bareness of the Treasury was, very often,
the natural result of the profligacy of the Court. But, in
1753, it was a fact.</p>

<p class='c029'>Save for Speaker <span class='sc'>Onslow’s</span> exertions, the Memorial would
have fared little better in Parliament than at Court. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>then Premier, Henry <span class='sc'>Pelham</span>, was not unfriendly to the
scheme, nor was he, like his royal master, a man of sordid
nature; but a Minister who was every now and then obliged
to write to his ambassadors abroad, even in the crisis of
important negotiations, ‘I have ordered you a part of your
last year’s appointments, but we are so poor that I can do
no more,’ could hardly be eager to provide forty or fifty
thousand pounds for the purchase of a new Museum and
the safety of an old Library.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1753. <i>Commons’ Journals</i>, March 19, seqq.</div>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Onslow</span> proposed—eventually—as a means of overcoming
these difficulties, that a sum of money should be
raised by a public lottery, and that it should be large
enough to effect not only the immediate objects contemplated
by the Will of Sir Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, and by the prior
public establishment of Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> Library, but
to purchase for a like purpose the noble series of Manuscripts
which had passed (just eleven years before <span class='sc'>Sloane’s</span>
death) to the executors of the last Earl of <span class='sc'>Oxford</span>, in trust
for his widow, the Dowager Countess, and for his daughter,
the Duchess of <span class='sc'>Portland</span>.</p>

<p class='c029'>Edward, Earl of <span class='sc'>Oxford</span>, had stood at one period of his
life, in the rank of the wealthiest of Englishmen. He was
the owner of estates worth some four or five hundred thousand
pounds. He was, too, a man of highly intellectual
and studious tastes; but, in his case, a magnificent style of
living, great generosity, and excessive trust in dependants,
did what is more usually the work of huge folly or of
gross sins; they brought him into circumstances which, for
his position in life, might almost be called those of poverty.
But for this comparative impoverishment, his own act—it is
more than probable—would have secured to posterity the
enjoyment, in its entirety, of the splendid library he had
inherited and increased.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>To the proposal of a lottery there was much solid objection.
What were then called ‘parliamentary lotteries’ had
been introduced expressly to put down those private lotteries,
common in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
which had been fraught with mischief. It was hoped, or
pretended, that a ‘regulated’ evil would be reduced within
tolerable limits, whilst bringing grist to the national mill.
But the forty years that had passed since the first parliamentary
lottery of 1709 had shown that the system was
essentially and incurably mischievous. <span class='sc'>Pelham</span> was averse
to its continuance. As First Lord of the Treasury, it was
his poverty, not his will, that consented to the adoption of
so questionable an expedient for the purchase of the <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>
Collections. He had not, individually, any such love of
learning as might have induced an appeal to Parliament to
set, for once, an example of liberal and far-sighted legislation.
He merely stipulated that some stringent provisos
should be put into the Act, directed against the nefarious
practices of the lottery-jobbers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Lottery of 1753 for the Purchase of the Sloane and Harleian Collections.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Eventually, it was enacted that there should be a hundred
thousand shares, at three pounds a share; that two hundred
thousand pounds should be allotted as prizes, and that the
remaining hundred thousand—less the expenses of the
lottery itself—should be applied to the threefold purposes
of the Act, namely, the purchase of the <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> and
<span class='sc'>Harleian</span> Collections; the providing of a Repository;
and the creation of an annual income for future maintenance.</p>

<p class='c035'>By the precautionary clauses of the Bill, provision was
made for the prolonged sale of shares; for the prevention
of the purchase by any one adventurer of more than twenty
shares, or ‘tickets,’ and for other impediments, as it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>thought, to a fraudulent traffic in the combined covetousness
and ignorance of the unwary.</p>

<p class='c029'>All these precautions proved to be vain. Mr. <span class='sc'>Pelham’s</span>
opposition was abundantly justified by the result. Fraud
proved to be, in that age, just as inseparable an element in
a Lottery scheme, however good its purpose, as fraud has
proved to be, in this age, an inseparable element (at one
stage or other of the business) in a Railway scheme,—however
useful the line proposed to be made.</p>

<p class='c029'>It thus came to pass that the foundation of the <span class='sc'>British
Museum</span> gave rise to a great public scandal. When evidence
was produced that many families had been brought
to misery, as the first incident in the annals of a beneficent
and noble foundation, a somewhat dull Session of
Parliament was suddenly enlivened by an animated and
angry debate.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Prosecution of Leheup for his dealings with the Museum Lottery.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The provident clauses in the Lottery Act of 1753 were
made of no effect, mainly by entrusting the chief share in
working the Act to an accomplished jobber. One Peter
<span class='sc'>Leheup</span> was made a Commissioner of the Lottery. This
man had held some employment or other at Hanover, from
which he had been recalled with circumstances of disgrace.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1753. December.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is to be inferred, from the way in which his name points
an epigrammatic phrase in one of the letters of <span class='sc'>Bolingbroke</span>,<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c030'><sup>[53]</sup></a>
and in more than one of those of Horace <span class='sc'>Walpole</span>,
that it had come, long before this appointment took place,
to have a sort of proverbial currency, like the names of
‘<span class='sc'>Curll</span>’ or of ‘<span class='sc'>Chartres</span>.’ But, be that as it may, Mr.
Commissioner <span class='sc'>Leheup</span> set on foot as thriving and as
flagitious a traffic in <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> lottery tickets, as was ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>set on foot in railway shares by a clever promoter of our
own day. He wrote circular letters instructing his correspondents
how most effectually to evade the Act. He sold
nearly three hundred tickets to a single dealer by furnishing
him with a list of ‘Roes’ and ‘Does,’ ‘Gileses’ and
‘Stileses’ at discretion. He supplied himself, with equal
liberality; and contrived to close the subscription, after an
actual publicity of exactly six hours—for the issue of one
hundred thousand tickets. In a few days, of course, tickets
in abundance were to be had, at sixteen shillings premium
upon each, and in what looked to be a still rising market.
The trap proved to be brilliantly ‘successful.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The subsequent explosion of parliamentary anger was
rather increased than lessened by an attempt of Henry <span class='sc'>Fox</span>
(afterwards the first Lord Holland) to extenuate <span class='sc'>Leheup’s</span>
offence by some arguments of the ‘<i>Tu quoque</i>’ sort. By a
great majority, the House of Commons sent up an address
praying the King to direct his Attorney General to prosecute
the chief offender, who was accordingly convicted and
fined a thousand pounds. It is not uninstructive to note
that Horace <span class='sc'>Walpole</span>—himself one of the <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> Trustees—treats
the matter in one of his letters exactly in the offhand
man-of-the-world style in which Henry <span class='sc'>Fox</span> had treated
it in the House of Commons.<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c030'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c029'>By this unfortunate episode, the name of one of the best
of Englishmen was brought into a sort of momentary connection
with the name of one of the worst. But the chief
discredit of the story does not really rest upon <span class='sc'>Leheup</span>. A
private citizen, of moderate means, had been willing to expend
seventy or eighty thousand pounds—besides an inestimable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>amount of labour and research—upon an object
essentially and largely public. Yet a British Parliament
could not summon up enough of public spirit to tax its own
members, in common with their tax-paying fellow subjects
throughout the realm, to the extent of a hundred thousand
pounds, in order to meet an obvious public want, to redeem
an actual parliamentary pledge, and to secure a conspicuous
national honour for all time to come. That want of public
spirit did not exhaust its results with the ruin of the poor
families, scattered here and there, whose scanty means had
been hazarded and lost by gambling, under a parliamentary
temptation. It impressed itself, so to speak, on the subsequent
history of the institution for more than forty years.
The Museum had been founded grudgingly. It was kept
up parsimoniously.</p>

<p class='c029'>Had that fact been otherwise, the story of the knavery
of Peter <span class='sc'>Leheup</span> would have little merited recital a century
after it, and he, had passed into oblivion.</p>

<p class='c029'>The value of so small an incident in the crowded story
of our National Museum lies simply in the fact that it forms
a just and salient illustration of the narrowness of spirit
with which the then representatives of the people received
the liberal gift of public benefactors. It serves to show
why it was that, from the year 1753 down to some years
after 1800, the History of the British Museum casts very
little honour on Britain as a nation, whereas the precedent
history of its integral parts, as separate and infant collections,
casts, and will long continue to cast, great honour on
the memory of the <span class='sc'>Cottons</span>, the <span class='sc'>Harleys</span>, and the <span class='sc'>Sloanes</span>,
by whom they were painfully gathered and most liberally
dispensed.</p>

<p class='c035'>Happily, as the course of this narrative—whatever its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>shortcomings—cannot fail to show, the literary and scientific
treasures which men of that stamp had collected, came, in
a subsequent generation (and, in a chief measure, by dint
of the exertions of the Trustees and Officers to whom they
had been, in course of time, confided) to be more adequately
estimated by Ministers and by Parliament in their public
capacity, as well as by the more cultivated portion of the
people generally. For more than a half-century past the
History of the British Museum has been one that any
Briton may take delight and pride in telling. And such
it promises to be, preeminently, in the time yet to come. In
a conspicuous sense, the men by whom it was first founded,
and the men by whom, for what is now a long time past,
it has been administered and governed, have alike been
true workers for Posterity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Book II</span>, Chap. 1 <span class='sc'>Early History of the British Museum.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The practical good sense which had always been a
marked characteristic in the life of Sir Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> is
seen just as plainly in those clauses of his Will by which
he leaves much latitude, in respect of means and agencies,
to the discretion of his Executors and Trustees. It is seen,
for example, when, after reciting some views of his own as
to the methods by which his Museum should be maintained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>for public use, he adds the proviso—‘in such manner as
they (the Trustees) shall think most likely to answer the
public benefit by me intended.’ He had a love for the
old Manor House at Chelsea, and contemplated, as it
seems, with some special complacency, the maintenance
there of the Collections which had added so largely to the
pleasures of his own fruitful life. But he was careful not
to tie down his Trustees to the continuance of the Museum
at Chelsea, as a condition of his bounty. They were at
liberty to assent to its removal, should the balance of
public advantage seem to them to point towards removal.</p>

<p class='c029'>Chelsea was in that day a quiet suburban village,
distant from the heart of London. As the site of a
Museum it had many advantages, but it was, comparatively
and to the mass of visitors and students, a long way off.
The Trustees assented to a generally expressed opinion that
whilst the new institution ought not to be placed in any of
the highways of traffic, it ought to be nearer to them than
it would be, if continued in its then abode.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Edmund, Duke of Buckingham, to Duke of Shrewsbury.</div>

<p class='c029'>One of the first places offered for their choice was the old
Buckingham House (now the royal palace). It was already
a large and handsome structure. The charm of its position,
at that time, was not unduly boasted of in the golden
letters of the inscription conspicuous upon its entablature—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c033'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<i>Sic siti lætantur lares.</i>’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'>Its prospects, as described not very long before by the
late ducal owner, ‘presented to view at once a vast town,
a palace, and a cathedral, on one side; and, on the other
sides, two parks, and a great part of Surrey.’ Its fine
gardens ended in ‘a little wilderness, full of blackbirds
and nightingales.’ Yet it was close to the Court end of
the town. But the price was thirty thousand pounds.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>Another offer was that of Montagu House at Bloomsbury.
Less charmingly placed, and architecturally less
striking in appearance than was its rival, both its situation
and its plan were better fitted for the purposes of a public
Museum.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Montagu House and its History.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It stood, it is true, on the extreme verge of the
London of that day. Northward, there was nothing
between it and the distant village of Highgate, save an
expanse of fields and hedgerows. And for a long distance,
both to the east and the west, no part of London had yet
spread beyond it, except an outlying hospital or two. But
there were already indications that the town would extend
in that northerly direction, more quickly than in almost
any other. The house had seven and-a-half acres of garden
and shrubberies; and its price was but ten thousand, two
hundred and fifty pounds.</p>

<p class='c029'>Montagu House had been built about sixty years before
for Ralph <span class='sc'>Montagu</span>, first Duke of Montagu. A spacious
court separated the house from Great Russell Street,
towards which it presented to view only a screen of pannelled
brickwork, having a massive gateway and cupola in
the centre, and turreted wings, masking the domestic
offices, at either end. The house itself was rather stately
than beautiful, but its chief rooms and its grand staircase
were elaborately painted by the best French artists of the
day. And the appendant offices were more than usually
extensive.</p>

<p class='c029'>It stood on the site of a structure of much greater architectural
pretensions, erected for the same owner, only
twelve years before, from the designs of Robert <span class='sc'>Hooke</span>.
That first Montagu House had been burned to the
ground.</p>

<p class='c029'>The offer of Montagu House was accepted by the Trustees
and approved by the Government. It was found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>needful to make considerable alterations in order to adapt
the building to its new uses. This outlay increased the
eventual cost of the mansion, and of its appliances and
fittings, to somewhat more than twenty-three thousand
pounds. The adaptation, with the removal and re-arrangement
of the Collections, occupied nearly five years. It was
not until the beginning of the year 1759 that the Museum
was opened for public inspection. When removed to
Bloomsbury, it was but brought back to within a few
hundred yards of its first abode.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Constitution of the Museum Trust.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>We have seen that according to the plan for the government
of the institution which <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> had sketched in his
Codicil of July, 1749, there would have been a Board of
Visitors as well as a Board of Trustees. But, by the
foundation Statute, enacted in 1753, both of these Boards
were incorporated into one. Forty-one Trustees were constituted,
with full powers of management and control. Six
of these were representatives of the several families of
<span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, <span class='sc'>Harley</span>, and <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, the head, or nearest in
lineal succession, of each family having the nomination,
from time to time, of such representatives or ‘Family
Trustees,’ when, by death or otherwise, vacancies should
occur. Twenty were ‘Official’ Trustees, in accordance, so
far, with <span class='sc'>Sloane’s</span> scheme for the constitution of his Board
of Visitors; and by these two classes, conjointly, the other
fifteen Trustees were to be elected.</p>

<p class='c029'>The Official Trustees were to be the holders for the time
being of the following offices:—(1) The Archbishop of
Canterbury, (2) the Lord Chancellor, (3) the Speaker of
the House of Commons, (4) the Lord President of the
Council, (5) the First Lord of the Treasury, (6) the Lord
Privy Seal, (7) the First Lord of the Admiralty, (8 and 9)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>the Secretaries of State, (10) the Lord Steward, (11) the
Lord Chamberlain, (12) the Bishop of London, (13) the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, (14) the Lord Chief Justice
of England, (15) the Master of the Rolls, (16) the Lord
Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, (17) the Attorney-General,
(18) the Solicitor-General, (19) the President of
the Royal Society, (20) the President of the College of
Physicians.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Act of 26 Geo. II, c. 22, Clauses 4–8.</div>

<p class='c029'>To the first three of these Official Trustees Parliament
entrusted the appointment, from time to time, of all the
Officers of the Museum, except the Principal Librarian,
who is to be appointed by the Crown, on the nomination
of the ‘Principal Trustees,’ as the first three Trustees—the
Archbishop, Chancellor, and Speaker—have always been
called.</p>

<p class='c035'>The following fifteen persons were the first <i>elected</i>
Trustees, under the Act of 1753:—The Duke of Argyle, the
Earl of Northumberland, Lord Willoughby of Parham, Lord
Charles Cavendish, the Honourable Philip Yorke, Sir George
Lyttelton, Sir John Evelyn, James West, Nicholas Hardinge,
William Sloane, William Sotheby, Charles Grey, the Reverend
Dr. Thomas Birch, James Ward, and William Watson.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Records of British Museum, in MS. <span class='sc'>Addit.</span>, 6179.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The first meeting of the Trustees under the Act was
held at the Cockpit, Whitehall, on the 17th of December,
1753.</p>

<p class='c029'>The first ‘Principal Librarian’<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c030'><sup>[55]</sup></a> was Dr. Gowin <span class='sc'>Knight</span>,
a member of the College of Physicians, and eminent, in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>day, as a cultivator of experimental science. Some magnetic
apparatus of his construction and gift was placed in
the Museum soon after its opening, and attracted, in its
day, much attention. He received the appointment after a
keen competition with the more widely-known physician
and botanist, Sir John <span class='sc'>Hill</span>. The first three ‘Keepers
of Departments’ were Dr. Matthew <span class='sc'>Maty</span>, Dr. Charles
<span class='sc'>Morton</span>, and Mr. James <span class='sc'>Empson</span>. Dr. <span class='sc'>Knight</span> retained
his post until 1772.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Maty</span> and <span class='sc'>Morton</span> succeeded in turn to the office of
Principal Librarian, and their respective services will have
a claim to notice hereafter. <span class='sc'>Empson</span> had been the valued
servant and friend of Sir Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>. He is the only
officer whose name appears in <span class='sc'>Sloane’s</span> Will. He had
served him as Keeper of the Museum at Chelsea for many
years.</p>

<p class='c035'>There is, in one of the letters of Horace <span class='sc'>Walpole</span> to
Sir Horace <span class='sc'>Mann</span>, an amusing account of an initiatory
meeting of the original Trustees, held prior to their formal
constitution by Parliament. It is marked by the writer’s
usual superciliousness towards all hobbies, except the dilettante
hobby which he himself was wont to ride so hard.
‘I employ my time chiefly, at present,’ he wrote to <span class='sc'>Mann</span>,
in February, 1753, ‘in the guardianship of embryos and
cockle shells. Sir Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> valued his Museum at
eighty thousand pounds, and so would anybody who loves
hippopotamuses, sharks with one ear, and spiders as big as
geese.... We are a charming wise set—all Philosophers,
Botanists, Antiquarians, and Mathematicians—and adjourned
our first meeting because Lord <span class='sc'>Macclesfield</span>, our
Chairman, was engaged in a party for finding out the
Longitude.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>‘One of our number,’ continues <span class='sc'>Walpole</span>, ‘is a Moravian,
who signs himself “Henry XXVIII, Count de
<span class='sc'>Reuss</span>.” The Moravians have settled a colony at Chelsea,
in Sir Hans’ neighbourhood, and I believe he intended to
beg Count Henry the Twenty-Eighth’s skeleton for his
Museum.’ This distinguished foreigner does not appear
in the parliamentary list.</p>

<p class='c029'>The Chairman of the preliminary meeting so airily
described by <span class='sc'>Walpole</span>, continued, under the definitive constitution
of the Trust, to take a leading part in its administration.
It appears to have been by Lord <span class='sc'>Macclesfield</span>
that the original ‘Statutes and Bye-laws’ of the Museum,
or many of them, were drafted.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Regulations for Admission and Study.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>In the form in which they were first issued, in 1759,
these statutes directed that the Museum should ‘be kept
open every day in the week, except Saturday and Sunday.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1759–1803.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For the greater part of the year the public hours were from
nine o’clock in the morning until three o’clock in the afternoon.
On certain days, in the summer months, the open
hours were from four o’clock in the afternoon until eight—so
as to meet the requirements of persons actively engaged
in business during the early part of the day. But the publicity
was hampered by a system of admission-tickets which
had to be applied for on a day precedent to that of every
intended visit. The application had first to be made, then
registered; a second application had to follow, in order to
receive the ticket; and the ticket could rarely be used at
the time of receiving it.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MS. <span class='sc'>Addit.</span>, 6179, ff. 36, seqq.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
So that, in practice, each visit to
the Museum had commonly to be preceded by two visits to
the ‘Porter’s Lodge.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The visitors were admitted in parties, at the prescribed
hours, and were conducted through the Museum by its
officers according to a routine which, practically and usually,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>allowed to each group of visitors only one hour for the inspection
of the whole. Special arrangements, however,
were made for those who resorted to the Museum for purposes
of study.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Statutes and Regulations</i>, part ii, § 3.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
To such, say the statutes, ‘a particular
room is allotted, in which they may read or write without
interruption during the time the Museum is kept open.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>MS. <span class='sc'>Addit.</span>, 6179, as above.</div>

<p class='c029'>The aggregate number of persons admitted as visitors—exclusive
of students—was, for some years, restricted to
sixty persons, as a maximum, in any one day.</p>

<p class='c035'>In order to give the reader a definite and clear idea of
what was seen, in 1759, by the earliest visitors to the
British Museum, in its rudimentary state, some sort of
ground plan is essential, but the merest outline will suffice
for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c029'>There were at Montagu House two floors or stories of
state apartments. The upper floor was that which was
first shown, after the formation of the Museum.</p>

<p class='c029'>The visitor, having ascended the superb staircase painted
by <span class='sc'>La Fosse</span>, passed through a vestibule and grand saloon
(<i>A</i> <i>B</i>) furnished with various antiquities, into the ‘Cottonian
Library’ (<i>C</i>), and thence into the ‘Harleian Library,’
which occupied three rooms (<i>D</i>, <i>E</i>, and <i>F</i>). He then
entered the ‘Medal Room’—containing the coins and
medals of the <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> and <span class='sc'>Cotton</span> collections (<i>G</i>); the
‘<span class='sc'>Sloane</span> Manuscript Room’ (<i>H</i>); and the room containing
the chief part of the antiquities (<i>I</i>)—</p>

<p><i>Rough Diagram, showing Principal Floor of the original British Museum of 1759.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>Then the visitor, passing again through the vestibule
(<i>A</i>) and great saloon (<i>B</i>), entered the rooms <i>K</i>, <i>L</i>, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span><i>M</i>. <i>K</i> contained the minerals and fossils of Sir Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane’s</span>
collection; <i>L</i>, the shells; <i>M</i>, the plants and insects.
Thence he passed into <i>N</i>, which was devoted to the bulk of
the <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> Zoological Collection, and into <i>O</i>, containing
artificial and miscellaneous curiosities.</p>

<p class='c029'>Descending to the floor beneath, by the secondary staircase
between <i>N</i> and <i>O</i>, the visitor then entered the small
room <i>P</i>, which contained the magnetic apparatus given by
Dr. Gowin <span class='sc'>Knight</span>, and the rooms, <i>Q</i> and <i>R</i> devoted to
the reception of the greater part of the Royal Library,
restored by <span class='sc'>Henry</span>, Prince of Wales, and augmented—but
with extreme parsimony—by several of the Stuart
monarchs, whose additions to the shelves were, indeed,
much oftener made of books given, than of books bought.
He then passed into <span class='sc'>Sloane’s</span> Printed Library, which
occupied the whole of the spacious and handsome suite of
rooms <i>S</i>, <i>T</i>, <i>V</i>, <i>W</i>, <i>X</i>, and <i>Y</i>, and (passing through the
Trustees’ Room <i>Z</i>,) entered the room <i>A A</i>, containing the
<span class='sc'>Edwards</span> Library; ending his tour of inspection in the
room <i>B B</i>, in which was arranged the remainder of the
old Royal Library, the main portion whereof had been
seen already in <i>Q</i> and <i>R</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c029'>When the combined Museum and Libraries, thus arranged,
were first opened to the inspection of the curious Public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>in 1759, the collections enumerated in the Foundation Act
of 1753 had, it is seen, already received some notable
increase by gifts.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Early Helpers in the Foundation and Growth of the British Museum.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The first donor was the House of Lords,
by whose order the historical collections of Thomas <span class='sc'>Rymer</span>,
royal historiographer, and editor of the <i>Fœdera</i>, were given
to the Trustees, immediately after their incorporation.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1755–57.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Then
followed, in 1757, the gift of the Royal Library and that
of the Lethieullier Antiquities from Egypt. [See Chapter II.]</p>

<p class='c029'>The next donor, in order of time, was a Jewish merchant,
and stock-broker, of humble origin, but of princely
disposition.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1759. <span class='sc'>Da Costa’s Hebrew Collection.—History of the Collector.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Solomon <span class='sc'>Da Costa</span> was one of the many men
who have done honour to commerce not merely by its successful
prosecution, but by the conspicuous union of mercantile
astuteness with noble tastes and true beneficence.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Correspondence of Thomas Hollis.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
His talents for business enabled him to make a hundred
thousand pounds—which in his day was more, perhaps,
than the equivalent of four hundred thousand in ours. He
had made it, says a keen observer, who knew the man well,
‘without scandal or meanness.’ When wealth made him
independent, he spent his new leisure, not in luxury but
in hard labour for the poor.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Da Costa</span> had come, from Amsterdam, into England, in
the year 1704. His struggling Hebrew compatriots were
among the earliest sharers in his bounty. But his heart
was too large to suffer that bounty to be limited by considerations
either of race or of local neighbourhood. To
him, as to the Samaritan of old, distress made kinship. He
was wont to journey, from time to time, through thirty or
forty parishes of Surrey and of Kent, with the punctual
diligence of a commercial traveller, simply to succour the
distressed by that best of all succour, the provision of
means through which, in time, self-help would be developed
and ensured. Provident loans, clothing-funds, the education
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>and apprenticeship of necessitous children, were the
forms in which <span class='sc'>Da Costa’s</span> benevolence delighted to invest
not only his money, but his personal exertion and his
cordial sympathy. He devoted more than a thousand
pounds a year to the benefit of Christian Englishmen,
besides all that he gave to the poor of his own faith and
race. And to both he gave, without noise or ostentation.</p>

<p class='c029'>He had, too, the breadth of view which enabled him to
put, on their true foot of equality, the claims of the necessitous
mind, as well as those of the necessitous body.
Unlike many other men of genuine beneficence, popular
estimates of giving did not mislead him into one-sidedness
of aim.</p>

<p class='c029'>Within a few years of <span class='sc'>Da Costa’s</span> arrival in England,
probably about the year 1720, and when, with youthful
ardour, he was seeking to acquire knowledge as well as to
make money, he met, at a bookseller’s, with a remarkable
collection of Hebrew books, of choice editions and in rich
and uniform bindings. The collection had that sumptuousness
of aspect which invited inquiry into its origin. All
that he could learn on that score was the probability that
some statesman or other of the Commonwealth period, had
collected them for a public but unfulfilled purpose, and
that they had fallen—with so much other spoil—into the
hands of <span class='sc'>Charles the Second</span>. By that King’s order
they had received, if not their rich binding, at least his
crown and cypher as marks of the royal appropriation, and
then (in a truly Carolinian fashion) were left in the hands
of the King’s stationer for lack of payment of the charge
of what—whether binding or mere decoration—had been
done to the books by the royal command. <span class='sc'>Da Costa</span>
prized them as among his chief treasures, but directly he
heard of the foundation of a great repository of learning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>the emotions of the Jewish broker were such as might
have been felt by ‘broad-browed <span class='sc'>Verulam</span>,’ could he
have lived to see that day; save only that <span class='sc'>Bacon</span> would
first have scanned the evidence about the origin of the
institution, and would have discriminated the praise.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Da Costa</span> wrote a letter to the Trustees. The generous
heart is facile in ascribing generosity. ‘A most stately
monument’ said <span class='sc'>Da Costa</span>, ‘hath been lately erected and
endowed, by the wisdom and munificence of the British
Legislature,’ and he accompanied his eulogy with a prayer

He brought his
mite of contribution, he added, not only as proof of sympathy
with the work in progress, ‘but as a thanksgiving
offering, in part, for the generous protection and numberless
blessings which I have enjoyed under the British
Government.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The gift embraced several Biblical Manuscripts of value,
and a still choicer series of early printed books, one hundred
and eighty in number. The giver has a merited place
in the roll of our public benefactors; and his devout prayer
for the new Museum, ‘May it increase and multiply&#160;...
to the benefit of the people of these nations and of the
whole earth,’ has had a more conspicuous fulfilment than
could, in 1759, have been imagined by the most sanguine
of bystanders.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Gift of the Thomason Collection of English Books of 1641–1662, by George III.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Three years afterwards, and soon after his accession to
the throne, King <span class='sc'>George the Third</span> gave to the Nation
that most curious assemblage of nearly the whole English
literature of two and twenty eventful years of Civil War,—open
or furtive,—which is known to the Public as the
‘Thomason Collection,’ though its technical name within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>the Museum walls continues, as of old, to be ‘the King’s
Tracts.’</p>

<p class='c029'>That name is the less appropriate from its tendency to
give an inaccurate idea of the contents of the King’s gift,
as well as from its disregard of the origin of the Collection.
The ‘tracts’ include the most ponderous theological quartos
that ever came from an English press as well as the tiniest
handbill, or the fugitive circular which called together a
‘Committee of Sequestrators’ at Wallingford House.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>George Thomason and his labours.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>George <span class='sc'>Thomason</span>, its collector, was an eminent London
bookseller, of royalist sympathies, who watched intensely
the progress of the great struggle between King and Parliament,
Cavalier and Roundhead, and who had noted with
professional keenness how strikingly the printing press was
made to mirror, almost from day to day, the strife of
senators in council, as well as that of soldiers in the
field. He had seized, in 1641, the idea of helping
posterity the better to realize every phase of the great
conflict, the oncoming of which many men had long
foreseen, by gathering everything which came out in
print—as far as vigilant industry could do so—whether
belonging to literature, and to the obvious materials of
history, or merely subserving the most trivial need of the
passing moment. He failed, of course, to secure everything;
but his endeavour was wonderfully successful, on the
whole. He also gathered many manuscripts which no printer
in England dared to put into type. And he obtained a
large number of political and historical pieces, bearing on
English affairs, which had issued from foreign presses;
their authors being sometimes foreign observers of the
struggle, but more frequently British refugees.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Charles the First</span> congratulated <span class='sc'>Thomason</span> on the
utility of his idea. More than once the King was able to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>gratify his curiosity by borrowing some tract or other which
only our collector was known to possess. The Parliament,
meanwhile, was far from exhibiting any literary sympathies
in the undertaking. Some of its leaders loved freedom of
the press when it was seen to be a channel for urging forward
their peculiar doctrines and aims, but had the gravest
doubts about its policy when it manifestly helped their
opponents and gave back blow for blow. The ‘Thomason
Collection’ came to be viewed, at length, much in the light
in which soldiers view an enemy’s battery. If it could be
captured and carried off, some of the pieces might be
turned against the enemy. If the attempt at complete
capture should miscarry, a sudden sally might at least
enable the assailants to destroy what they had failed to
secure.</p>

<p class='c029'>Hence it was that the poor Collector came to be in such
alarm about the possible fate of his treasures that he had
them repeatedly packed into cases, and, as the successes of
the war veered to and fro, sent them, at one time, far to the
south of London; at another time, as far to the east; now,
smuggled them, concealed between the real and false tops
of tables, into a city warehouse; and anon made a colourable
sale of them to the University of Oxford.</p>

<p class='c029'>When the King enjoyed his own again, the Collection
was offered, as fit to be made a royal one. It contained
more than thirty-three thousand separate publications—bound
in about 2,200 volumes—issued between 1640 and
1662 inclusive. But <span class='sc'>Charles the Second</span> was busied
with pursuits having little to do with any kind of learning,
and was ill inclined, as we have seen already, to burden his
Treasury for the enrichment of his Library. Sir Thomas
<span class='sc'>Bodley’s</span> Trustees at Oxford refused the offer, in their
turn, under a very different but scarcely less obstructive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>pressure. Their excellent founder had formed peculiar
and stringent views about the literature worthy of a great
University. He had warned them against stuffing his
library with ‘mere baggage books.’ And so future
Bodleian curators had, in another age, to buy with large
bank notes many things which their predecessors could
have bought with small silver coins;—just as in the
ancient story.</p>

<p class='c029'>The unfortunate Collection went a-begging. The books
passed from hand to hand, somewhat, it would seem, by
way of pledge or mortgage. They had cost a large sum
of money, and a larger amount of toil. When his expectations
were at their best the first owner, it is said, refused
several thousands of pounds for them.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Acquirement of the Thomason Collection by George III.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
His ultimate successors
in the possession were glad, in 1762, to accept, at
the hands of King <span class='sc'>George the Third</span>, three hundred
pounds. The purchase was recommended to him by Thomas
<span class='sc'>Hollis</span>, and also by Lord <span class='sc'>Bute</span>, as a serviceable addition
to the newly founded Museum.

information yet unused.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Brander Fossils.</span></div>

<div class='sidenote'>1766.</div>

<p class='c029'>The next augmentor of the Museum was one of its
Trustees, Gustavus <span class='sc'>Brander</span>, distinguished as a promoter
of natural science, and more especially of mineralogy and
palæontology in the early stages of their study in England.
A remarkable collection of fossils found in Hampshire, in
the London Clay, was given by Mr. <span class='sc'>Brander</span> to the Public,
after having been, at his cost, carefully examined and
described by Dr. <span class='sc'>Solander</span>. It was the first notable contribution
to the grand series of specimens in palæontology
which, in their combination, have made the British Museum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>the most important of all repositories in that department of
science.</p>

<p class='c029'>To the Zoological Collections, the additions made,
whether by gift or by purchase—save as the result, more
or less direct, of ‘Voyages of Discovery,’ which will be
noticed presently—were for many years very unimportant.
The first purchase worthy of record was a collection of
stuffed birds, formed in Holland, and acquired, in 1769,
for four hundred and sixty pounds. This purchase was
made by the Trust.</p>

<p class='c035'>The reign of <span class='sc'>George the Third</span> is marked by very few
characteristics which are more honourable, both to King
and people, than is its long series of expeditions to remote
countries made expressly, or mainly, for purposes of geographical
and scientific discovery, and extending over almost
the whole of the reign.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Accessions accruing from Voyages of Discovery.</span> 1760–1820.</div>

<p class='c029'>Scarcely one voyage of the long series failed to bring,
directly or indirectly, some valuable accession or other to
the Collection of Natural History. Sometimes such accessions
came to the Museum as the gifts of the navigators
and explorers themselves. In this class of donors the name
of Captain James <span class='sc'>Cook</span>,<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c030'><sup>[56]</sup></a> and that of Archibald <span class='sc'>Menzies</span>,
occur both early and frequently. Sometimes they came as
the gifts of the Board of Admiralty. Sometimes, again,—and
not infrequently—as those of the King, who, in his best
days, took a keen interest in enterprise of this kind, and
delighted in talking with the captains of the discovery ships
about their adventures, and about the marvels of the far-off
lands they had been among the first to see. Nor did the
King stand alone in his active encouragement of remote explorations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>Many of the great and wealthy nobles gave
generous furtherance to them, and were equally ready to
make available for scientific study the new specimens which
the ships brought home. In this way, for example, the
Marquess of <span class='sc'>Rockingham</span> gave to the Museum a curious
collection of reptiles gathered in Surinam.</p>

<p class='c029'>In the same manner was furnished that minor, but very
popular and instructive, collection illustrating the rude arts
and modes of life of the newly explored countries, which
some yet among us can remember as occupying the ‘South
Sea Room’ of the old house. In the course of years it
came to be eclipsed by much better collections of the same
kind elsewhere, and so to wear a meagre and somewhat
obsolete aspect. But it had rendered good service in its day,
and was the germ of what will become, it may be hoped, in
due time, an ethnological collection worthy of a seafaring
people.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Epochs in the Growth of the Natural History Collections.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>As regards the Natural History Collections, the growth
of the Museum may be said to have been mainly dependent
on the Voyages of Discovery for more than forty years.
That source of improvement seems to mark, distinctively,
the first epoch in the history of those collections. Then
came a second epoch, marked by some approach to systematic
improvement, in all branches, by means of the purchase
of entire private collections as opportunity offered.
A third period may be dated from the acquisition of the
botanical and other gatherings of Sir Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span> in 1827.
Sir Joseph’s splendid gift was soon followed by so many
other gifts—sometimes as donations, more frequently as
bequests—that for many years the liberality of benefactors
quite eclipsed the liberality of Parliament. Only of late years
can it be said that the public support of the Natural History
Collections has been worthy, either of the Nation or of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>own intrinsic importance to it. By degrees, statesmen have
become convinced that such collections are much more than
the implements of a knot of professed naturalists, and the
toys of the public at large. Slowly, but surely, the economic
and commercial value of a great museum of natural
history, as well as its educational value, have come saliently
into view. And a wise enlargement of the contributions
from national funds has had the excellent result of stimulating,
instead of checking, the benefactions of individuals.</p>

<p class='c029'>Some of the particular steps by which so conspicuous an
improvement has been gradually brought about will claim
our notice hereafter, in their due order.</p>

<p class='c035'>If, for a long series of years, the degree of liberality
with which these varied collections were shown to the Public
at large scarcely accorded, either with their origin, or with
the purpose for which they had been avowedly combined,
it should be borne in mind that ‘the Public’ of 1759 was
a very different body from the Public of a century later. It
is only by degrees that indiscriminate admission to museums
has come to be either very useful or quite feasible. There
was a good deal of warrant in 1759 for the opinion recorded
by one of the Trustees when the Rules were first under
discussion.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MS. <span class='sc'>Addit.</span>, 6179, f. 61.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘A general liberty,’ said Dr. John <span class='sc'>Ward</span>,
the eminent Gresham Professor, ‘to ordinary people of all
ranks and denominations, is not to be kept within bounds.
Many irregularities will be committed that cannot be prevented
by a few librarians who will soon be insulted by
such people [as commit abuses], if they offer to control or
contradict them.’ But, after all, the inadequate strength
of the staff was the main cause of such of the restrictions as
were chiefly complained of.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>The original regulations, with but small change, remained
in force for about forty-five years. How they
worked will be best and most briefly shown by citing the
experiences of two or three notable visitors, at various
periods, during the last century.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Grosley’s Account of the Museum in 1765.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>In 1765, Peter John <span class='sc'>Grosley</span>, an accomplished and keen-eyed
Frenchman, familiar with the Museums of Italy as well
as with those of his own country, visited the new Museum,
and recorded his impressions of it. With the building he
was charmed. He had already seen many parts of England,
but nowhere any house that he thought worthy to be
compared with Montagu House. He calls it ‘the largest,
the most stately, the best arranged, and most richly decorated’
structure of its kind in all England. He made repeated
visits. What chiefly arrested his attention in the
Natural History rooms were the beauty of the papillonacea—comprising,
he thought, ‘all that either the old world
or the new can supply in this kind’—and the strangeness of
some mineral specimens brought from the Giant’s Causeway
in Ireland. The Printed Books he thought to be ‘the
weakest part of this vast collection.’ In one of the principal
rooms, ‘I saw,’ he continues, ‘not without astonishment,
a very fine bust of Oliver <span class='sc'>Cromwell</span>, occupying a
distinguished place!’ He praises the courtesy with which
Drs. <span class='sc'>Maty</span> and <span class='sc'>Morton</span> discharged, by turns, the duty of
exhibition. ‘They show,’ he says, ‘the most obliging
readiness to explain things to the visitor, but,’ he adds,
with obvious truth, ‘their very courtesy is wont to make
a stranger content himself with hasty and unsatisfactory
glances, that he may not trespass on their politeness.’ And
then he makes a wise practical suggestion, which was
carried into effect, almost half a century afterwards.</p>

<p class='c029'>‘In order really to carry out the intentions of Parliament,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>writes <span class='sc'>Grosley</span>, in 1765, ‘it is to be wished that the
Public should be admitted more liberally, and more easily,
by placing a warder in every room, to be continually
present during the public hours.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Ten years afterwards, the difficulty on this score had so
increased that a notification to the following effect was
circulated: ‘British Museum, 9th August, 1776.
The
Applicants of the middle of April are not yet satisfied.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MS. <span class='sc'>Addit.</span>, 10,555, fol. 14.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Persons applying are requested to send weekly to the
porter to know how near they are upon the List.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Visit of C. P. Moritz in 1782.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>In 1782, the plan had so far improved that instead of
waiting from April until August, a visitor could usually
get admission within a fortnight or so after applying for a
ticket. We have an intelligent and amusing account of a
visit then made. This time the narrator is a German,—Charles
<span class='sc'>Moritz</span>, of Berlin. ‘In general,’ writes <span class='sc'>Moritz</span>,
‘you must give in your name a fortnight before you can be
admitted. But, by the kindness of Mr. <span class='sc'>Woide</span>’—a countryman
of the traveller, and, at that time, an Assistant-Librarian
in the Museum,—‘I got admission earlier....
Yet, after all, I am sorry to say that it was the room,
the glass-cases, the shelves,&#160;... which I saw; not the
Museum itself, so rapidly were we hurried on through the
departments. The company who saw it when I did, and
in like manner, was variously composed. They were of all
sorts, and some, as I believe, of the very lowest classes of
the people of both sexes, for, as it is, the property of the
Nation, every one has the same ‘right’—I use the term of
the country—to see it that another has.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Wendeborn’s Account of the Museum.</span> 1780–90.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
I had Mr. <span class='sc'>Wendeborn’s</span>
book in my pocket, and it, at least, enabled me
to take more particular notice of some of the principal
things.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The book thus referred to by <span class='sc'>Moritz</span> is the German
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>original of that account of English society and institutions
which <span class='sc'>Wendeborn</span> himself translated, a few years afterwards,
into English, and published at London, under the
title of <i>A View of England</i>.</p>

<p class='c029'>Its author had settled in London as the Minister of a
German Congregation. He was himself a studious frequenter
of the Museum, and says of it: ‘The whole is
costly, worth seeing, and honourable to the Nation; when
taken altogether it has not its equal. When considered in
its separate branches, almost each of them singly may be
surpassed by some other collection even in England itself.’
But the only collection which he specifies as, in this sense,
superior, are the Hunterian Museum, and that which had
been formed by Sir Ashton <span class='sc'>Lever</span>, and which, when the
<i>View of England</i> was written, belonged to Mr. <span class='sc'>Parkinson</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Wendeborn, <i>A View of England</i>, vol. i, 323–325.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Of the Museum Library, <span class='sc'>Wendeborn</span> says, ‘though a
numerous and valuable collection, it is yet, in many respects,
very deficient, and as to its use, much circumscribed.’</p>

<p class='c029'>When the German visitor of 1782 pulled Mr. <span class='sc'>Wendeborn’s</span>
book from his pocket, as he was hurried
through the Museum, the action attracted the attention
of the other visitors. The more intelligent of them
pressed round him to see if the book could be made
to yield any information for their behoof also. And the
stranger gratified their curiosity by translating a passage
or two in explanation of the objects they were passing.
Then came an exquisite bit of sub-officialism.</p>

<p class='c029'>‘The gentleman who conducted us’ observes <span class='sc'>Moritz</span>,
‘took little pains to conceal the contempt which he felt for
my communications when he found it was only a German
description of the British Museum which I had.’ ‘So rapid
a passage,’ he continues, ‘through a vast suite of rooms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>in little more than one hour of time, with opportunity to
cast but one poor longing look of astonishment on
all the vast treasures of nature, antiquity, and literature,
in the examination of which one might profitably
spend years, confuses, stuns, and overpowers the
visitor.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Two years later, we have a similar account of the experiences
of an inquisitive Englishman, and of one who is
much more outspoken in his complaint.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>William Hutton’s Visit in 1784.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
William <span class='sc'>Hutton</span>,
the historian of Birmingham, came to London in December,
1784. ‘I was unwilling to quit it,’ he writes, ‘without
seeing what I had, many years, wished to see. But how
to accomplish it was the question. I had not one relative
in that vast metropolis to direct me.... By good
fortune, I stumbled upon a person possessing a ticket for
the next day, which he valued less than two shillings. We
struck a bargain in a moment and were both pleased....
I was not likely to forget Tuesday, December 7th, at eleven.’
<span class='sc'>Hutton</span>, shrewd as he was, did not suspect the real nature
of his ‘bargain.’ He had met with a professional dealer in
Museum tickets; one of several who, on a humbler
scale, followed in the steps of Peter <span class='sc'>Leheup</span>, but were
lucky enough not to excite the anger of the House of
Commons.</p>

<p class='c029'>He was taken through the rooms in company with
about ten other persons, at a very rapid rate. He asked
their conductor for some information about the curiosities.
The reply, he says, so humbled him that he could not utter
another word. ‘The company seemed influenced. They
made haste and were silent. No voice was heard but in
whispers. If a man spends two minutes in a room, in
which a thousand things demand his attention, he cannot
bestow on them a glance apiece.... It grieved me to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>think how much I lost for want of a little information. In
about thirty minutes we finished our silent journey through
the princely mansion, which would well have taken thirty
days.... I had laid more stress on the British Museum,
than on anything else which I should see in London.
It was the only sight which disgusted me....
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Hutton, <i>A Journey to London</i>, pp. 187–196.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Government
purchased this rare collection at a vast expense, and
exhibits it as a national honour.... How far it answers
the end proposed this account will testify.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Better days were at hand. But it was not until 1805
that the rules of admission were even so far effectively
revised as to abolish the traffic in tickets. Nor was any
‘Synopsis’ of the contents of the Museum provided until
1808. In that year admission tickets were abolished
wholly.</p>

<p class='c035'>Straitened means of maintenance have, at all times, had
far more to do with any inadequate provision for public
usefulness of which (in days long past) there may have been
well-grounded cause of complaint, than had neglect or
oversight on the part of any officer.</p>

<p class='c029'>The officers, too, were, for a very long period after
the establishment of the Museum, engaged, and remunerated,
only for an attendance, in rotation, for two
hours daily, on alternate days. A largely increased
provision by Parliament was the essential condition
of any large increase in the accessibility of the institution.</p>

<p class='c029'>As early as in 1776 the necessary expenditure in salaries
and wages alone (at a very low scale of payment), exceeded
the annual income (£900) accruing from the original endowment
fund. After Parliament had made an additional
provision—first introduced in a clause of what was then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>called a ‘hotch-potch Act’—averaging £1000 yearly, the
total annual income was still but £2448, including the
yearly three hundred pounds accruing from the ‘<span class='sc'>Edwards</span>
Fund,’ and the £248, paid, under the grant of <span class='sc'>George
the Second</span>, as the net yearly salary of the ‘King’s
Librarian.’ For a considerable period, the sums expended
in purchases—for all the departments collectively—had
not amounted, in any one year, to one hundred
pounds.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Career of Dr. Matthew Maty.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>On the decease of the first Principal Librarian, Dr.
Gowin <span class='sc'>Knight</span>, in 1772, Dr. Matthew <span class='sc'>Maty</span> was appointed
to that office. He was born at, or in the neighbourhood
of Utrecht, in 1718, and was educated in the University
of Leyden, where he took his degrees in 1740, the subject
of his inaugural dissertation, for that of M.A. and Doctor
of Philosophy, being ‘custom,’ and its wide results and influence
social and political. His essay was published (under
the title <i>Dissertatio philosophica inauguralis de Usu</i>,) in
1740. For the degree of Doctor in Medicine, he treated of
the effects of habit and custom upon the human frame (<i>De
Consuetudinis efficacia in corpus humanum</i>). This medical
dissertation was also published at Leyden, in the usual form,
in the same year. Both essays showed much ability, along
with many faults and crudities. Some of these became
matters of conversation and correspondence between the
author and his friends. The subject was less hacknied
than that of the majority of academical essays, and <span class='sc'>Maty</span>
was induced to reconsider it. He republished the result
of his thoughts, in a greatly improved form, in the following
year at Utrecht, and, to gain a wider audience, wrote in
French. The <i>Essai sur l’Usage</i> attracted much attention,
and served to pave the way for the establishment by its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>author, eight years afterwards, of the periodical entitled,
<i>Journal Britannique</i>, as editor of which he is now best
remembered. He came to England in 1741, practised as
a physician, attained considerable reputation, and distinguished
himself more especially by following in the path
of Sir Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, and others, as an earnest supporter
of the practice of inoculation. In this field he was able
to render good service, both by his professional influence
and by his pen. In the sharp controversies which soon,
and for a time, impeded the new practice, he took a large
share, and his publications on the subject are distinguished
from many others by their union of moderation of tone
with vigour of advocacy.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Maty’s</span> predilections, however, pointed to a literary rather
than to a medical career. He had early taken that ply,
and it was not easily effaced. Within six years (1750–1756)
he published eighteen volumes of the <i>Journal Britannique</i>—edited
in London but printed at the Hague—in
the toils of which he was, according to <span class='sc'>Gibbon</span>, almost
unaided. <span class='sc'>Gibbon</span>, too, bears testimony to the amiability
of the man, as well as to the industry of the writer. His
own first and youthful achievement in literature had <span class='sc'>Maty’s</span>
encouragement and active aid.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Memoirs of Gibbon</i>, p. 107.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When the <i>Essai sur
l’Etude de la Littérature</i> was, after much filing and polishing,
given to the Public, a preliminary letter from <span class='sc'>Maty’s</span> pen
accompanied it, and by him the essay was carried through
the press.</p>

<p class='c029'>When he succeeded Dr. Gowin <span class='sc'>Knight</span>, as Principal
Librarian in 1772, his health was already failing. He
occupied the post during less than four years. To the
last, his pen was busily employed. He was a contributor
to several foreign journals, as well as to the <i>Philosophical
Transactions</i>, some volumes of which he edited, or assisted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>to edit, in his capacity as one of the Secretaries of the
Royal Society, to which office he had been appointed in
1765. Among his minor literary publications are a life of
<span class='sc'>Boerhaave</span>, in French, and one of Dr. Richard <span class='sc'>Mead</span>, in
English. At the time of his death he was working on the
<i>Life of Lord Chesterfield</i>, afterwards prefixed to the collective
edition of the Earl’s <i>Miscellaneous Works</i>. Dr. <span class='sc'>Maty</span> died
in 1776, and was succeeded in his Librarianship by his
colleague, Dr. Charles <span class='sc'>Morton</span>, who had had, from the
beginning, the charge of the department of Manuscripts,
and had also acted as Secretary to the Trustees.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Notice of Dr. Charles Morton, Third Principal Librarian.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Dr. <span class='sc'>Morton</span> was a native of Westmoreland, and was
born in 1716. Until the year 1750 he had practised as a
physician at Kendal. In 1751 he became a Licentiate of
the College of Physicians, and in the following year a
Fellow of the Royal Society. His service in the British
Museum lasted from 1756 to 1799. There are several testimonies
to the courtesy with which he treated such visitors
and students as came under his personal notice, but his
long term of superior office was certainly not marked by
any striking improvement in the public economy of the
Museum. And how much room for improvement existed
there the reader has seen. Dr. <span class='sc'>Morton</span>, like his predecessor,
was one of the Secretaries of the Royal Society.
He filled that office from the year 1760 to 1774. He
contributed several papers to the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>,
as well on antiquarian subjects as on topics of
physical science, and he was the first editor of Bulstrode
<span class='sc'>Whitelocke’s</span> remarkable narrative of his embassy to
Sweden during the Protectorate. <span class='sc'>Morton’s</span> writings are
not remarkable either for vigour or for originality, but, on
more topics than one, they had the useful result of setting
abler men awork. He was three times married: (1) to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>Mary <span class='sc'>Berkeley</span>, the niece of <span class='sc'>Swift’s</span> frequent correspondent
Lady Elizabeth <span class='sc'>Germaine</span>; (2) to Lady <span class='sc'>Savile</span>;
(3) to Mrs. Elizabeth <span class='sc'>Pratt</span>. He died on the 10th February,
1799.</p>

<p class='c029'>Of his successors in the office of Principal Librarian
some account will be found in the Introductory Chapter of
Book III.</p>

<p class='c029'>To the comparatively small assemblage of antiquities
which originally formed part of the Museum of <span class='sc'>Courten</span>
and of <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, several additions had been made—besides
the coins, medals, and bronzes of Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>—prior
to the opening of the British Museum to the Public in
1759. Some of those additions were the gift, severally, of
three members of the <span class='sc'>Lethieullier</span> family. Others were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>the gift of Thomas <span class='sc'>Hollis</span>, who became a constant benefactor
to the Museum almost from the day of Sir Hans
<span class='sc'>Sloane’s</span> death to that of his own.</p>

<p class='c029'>The <span class='sc'>Lethieullier</span> antiquities had been chiefly gathered
in Egypt.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Egyptian Antiquities of the Lethieulliers.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The first gift was made by the Will of Colonel
William <span class='sc'>Lethieullier</span>, dated 23rd July, 1755.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MS. <span class='sc'>Addit.</span>,
6179, f. 29.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And
the first catalogue of any kind which was prepared for the
British Museum, after its acquisition by Parliament, was a
list of these antiquities drawn up by Dr. John <span class='sc'>Ward</span>, one
of the Trustees. And here it may deserve remark that for
many years after the foundation not a few of the Trustees
took a large share in the actual work of preparing the
Museum for public use, as well as in the ordinary duties of
control and administration.</p>

<p class='c029'>To the gift of Colonel William <span class='sc'>Lethieullier</span>, his cousin,
Smart <span class='sc'>Lethieullier</span>, and his nephew, Pitt <span class='sc'>Lethieullier</span>,
made several additions between the years 1756 and 1770.
The last-named of these gentlemen, when receiving, as executor
of his uncle, the personal thanks of a Committee of the
Trustees (February, 1756), for the bequest so made, took
the opportunity of augmenting it by the gift of some
antiquities which he had himself collected during his
residence at Grand Cairo.</p>

<p class='c029'>But the first large and comprehensive addition in the
archæological department was that made in 1772 by the
purchase, by means of a Parliamentary grant, of the Museum
of Antiquities, which had been formed during seven years’
researches in Italy by Sir William <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>, our Ambassador
at Naples.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Sir William Hamilton and his career at Naples.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Sir William <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> was among the earliest of British
diplomatists who, by a voluntary choice, turned to good
account, in the interests of learning and of the public, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>opportunities which diplomatic life so frequently offers for
amassing treasures of literature and science, and (in many
cases) for saving them from peril of destruction. In that
path Frenchmen had showed the way many generations
earlier.</p>

<p class='c029'>As far, indeed, as regards a public and national care for
matters of the intellect, France is far better entitled to claim
a priority in the proud distinction of ‘teaching the nations
how to live,’ than is any other country in the world. It is
to her immortal honour that from a very early period, and
even in times of sore trouble, her sovereigns and her statesmen
have known how to turn public resources to the
promotion of public culture, as well as of national power.
A man may read in French diplomatic letters of instruction
of the sixteenth century orders to collect manuscripts and
antiquities, as implements of public education, such as he
would look for in vain in parallel British documents of any
century at all,—inclusive of the present;—although it is
certain that the omission has by no means arisen from
the engrossment of our diplomatists in weightier concerns.</p>

<p class='c029'>In Sir William <span class='sc'>Hamilton’s</span> case the liberal tastes and
the mental energy of the individual supplied the defect of
his instructions. He set an example which not a few of our
ambassadors have voluntarily followed with like public
spirit, and with results not less conspicuous.</p>

<p class='c035'>William <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> was the fourth son of Lord Archibald
<span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>, youngest son of James, third Duke of <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>,
K.G. His mother, Lady Jane <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>, was of
that illustrious family by birth, as well as by marriage,
being the daughter of James, sixth Earl of <span class='sc'>Abercorn</span>. He
was born in the year 1730.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>Towards the close of his career, Sir William would sometimes
say to his intimates, when conversation turned upon
the battle of life: ‘I had to begin the world with a great
name, and one thousand pounds for all my fortune.’ But
the world never used him very roughly. Whilst still a
young man (1755) he married Miss <span class='sc'>Barlow</span>, the wealthy
heiress of Hugh <span class='sc'>Barlow</span>, of Laurenny Hall, in Pembrokeshire.
She brought him an estate, in the neighbourhood
of Swansea, worth nearly five thousand pounds a year; but
it was his happy lot to have married a true wife, not a bag
of money. <span class='sc'>Duclos</span>, who saw much of the <span class='sc'>Hamiltons</span> in
their family circle at Naples in after years, was wont to
say, ‘They are the happiest couple I ever saw.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1764–1800.</div>

<p class='c029'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> was sent to the Court of Naples in 1764.
The post, in that day, was not overburdened with business.
And for some years to come the new Ambassador found
the Neapolitan society little to his taste. He was intellectual,
and, in the truest sense, an English gentleman.
The tone of society at that time in Naples was both frivolous
and dissolute. He had to form, by slow degrees, a
circle in which a man of cultivated tastes might enjoy social
life. The public duties of the embassy could employ but
a small portion of his time, and the temper of the man
made employment to him a necessary of life. He threw
his energies into hard study. And he possessed that happiest
of mental characteristics, an equal love of the natural
sciences, and of the world of art and of books. He could
pore, with like enjoyment, on the deep things of Nature,
and on the secrets of ‘the antiquary times.’ And in both
paths, he knew how to make his personal enjoyments teem
with public good.</p>

<p class='c029'>His first labours were given to the exhaustive research
of volcanic phenomena. He amazed the fine gentlemen of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>Naples by setting to work as though he had to win his
bread by the sweat of his brow. He laboured harder on
the slopes of Vesuvius than an exceptionally diligent craftsman
would labour in a factory—had Naples possessed any.
Within four years he ascended the famous mountain
twenty-two times. More than one of these ascents was
made at the risk of his life. He made, and caused to be
made, innumerable drawings of all the phenomena that he
observed, showing the volcanic eruption in all its stages, and
under every kind of meteorological condition. He formed
too a complete collection of volcanic products, and of the
earths and minerals of the volcanic district. When he had
studied Vesuvius under every possible aspect, he went to
Etna.</p>

<p class='c029'>The results of these elaborate investigations were sent,
from time to time, to the Royal Society (of which Mr.
<span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> was made a Fellow, after the reading of the
first of his papers in 1766), and they were published in the
<i>Philosophical Transactions</i>, between the years 1766 and
1780. They were afterwards collected, and improved, in
the two beautiful volumes entitled <i>Campi Phlegræi</i>, and
were lavishly illustrated from the drawings of F. A. <span class='sc'>Fabris</span>,
who had been trained by <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> to the work.<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c030'><sup>[57]</sup></a> The
collection of volcanic geology and products was given to
the British Museum in 1767.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Hamilton Museum of Antiquities.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>These geological labours had been diversified, at intervals,
by the collection of a rich archæological museum,
and by the establishment of a systematic correspondence on
antiquarian subjects with men of learning in various parts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>of the kingdom of the Two Sicilies. This correspondence
had for its object, not merely the enrichment of his own
Museum, but the awakening of local attention throughout
the country to its antiquities and history; matters which
had theretofore been but too much neglected—in the Neapolitan
fashion.</p>

<p class='c029'>One of the earliest and choicest acquisitions made by
<span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> in the early years of his residence at Naples was
a collection of vases belonging to the senatorial family of
<span class='sc'>Porcinari</span>, many of which had been gathered from sepulchres
and excavations in Magna Græcia. This purchase,
made in 1766 and afterwards largely increased, may be
regarded as the substantial beginning of the noble series
of vases now so prominent a part of our National
Museum.</p>

<p class='c029'>Thus had been formed, by degrees, at Naples, a museum
which, at the beginning of the year 1772, included seven
hundred and thirty fictile vases; a hundred and seventy-five
terra-cottas; about three hundred specimens of ancient
glass (including three of the most perfect cinerary urns
known, at that time, to have been discovered); six hundred
and twenty-seven bronzes, of which nearly one-half illustrated
the arms and armour of the ancients; more than two
hundred specimens of sacrificial, domestic, and architectonic,
instruments and implements; fourteen bassi-relievi, busts,
masques, and inscribed tablets; about a hundred and fifty
miscellaneous pieces of ancient ivory, including a curious
series of tessaræ; a hundred and forty-nine gems, chiefly
scarabæi; a hundred and forty-three personal ornaments, of
various kinds, in gold; a hundred and fifty-two fibulæ in
various materials; and more than six thousand coins and
medals, comprising a considerable series from the towns of
Magna Græcia.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>The first fruits of this noble collection was the publication,
commenced in the year 1766, of the work entitled
<i>Antiquités Etrusques</i>, &amp;c., with admirable illustrations, and
with a descriptive text, written in French by <span class='sc'>D’Hancarville</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Publication
of the
‘Antiquités
Etrusques.’</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The first edition of this costly book was issued
at Naples. It naturally attracted great attention. No
such collection of fictile vases—in their combination of
number and beauty—had been theretofore known.</p>

<p class='c029'>The two volumes published at Sir William’s cost in
1766, were followed by two other volumes in 1767. All of
them were executed with great care and with lavish expenditure.
But the later edition, printed at Florence—long
afterwards—is in many points superior.<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c030'><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c029'>Whilst the volumes were still incomplete, Mr. <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>
circulated proof plates of the work with great liberality.
Some of these proofs were lent to our famous English
potter, Josiah <span class='sc'>Wedgwood</span>, and gave a strong impulse to
his taste and artistic zeal.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Meteyard, <i>Life of Josiah Wedgwood</i>, vol. ii, p. 72.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But they excited an eager
longing for access to the vases themselves, as the only satisfactory
models.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Wedgwood to Bentley, 10 May, 1770.</div>

<p class='c029'>When <span class='sc'>Wedgwood</span> wrote to his friend and partner,
<span class='sc'>Bentley</span>;—‘Mr. <span class='sc'>Hambleton</span>, you know, has flattered the
old pot-painters very much,’ one feels that for the moment
that excellent man’s prepossessions had been rubbed a little,
against the grain. But he shows directly that there is no
real intent to impeach the Editor’s honesty in the matter.
‘He has, no doubt,’ adds <span class='sc'>Wedgwood</span>, ‘taken his designs
from the very best vases extant,’ which was precisely what
it was his duty to do, since selection was the task in hand,
not the publication of seven hundred specimens.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>This Collection—far more remarkable than any, of its
kind, which had yet come to England—was brought over
in 1772, and offered to the Trustees of the British Museum.
An appeal was made to Parliament, and the first grant of
public money, worthy of mention, was now made in order
to its acquisition. The sum given to Mr. <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> was
eight thousand four hundred pounds.</p>

<p class='c029'>How soon one of the incidental results of the acquisition
returned to the Public much more than its cost—leaving
out of account altogether the best returns which accrue
from such Collections—is among the familiar annals of our
commerce. Josiah <span class='sc'>Wedgwood</span> told a Committee of the
House of Commons that, within two years, he had himself
brought into England, by his imitations of the Hamilton
vases in his manufactory at Etruria, about three times the
sum which the Collection had cost to the country.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Explorations at Pompeii and Herculaneum.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>At the beginning of the year 1772 Mr. <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> was
made a Knight of the Bath. He returned to Naples soon
after the transfer of his antiquities to the Museum, and ere
long he was busily engaged in new explorations at Pompeii
and at Herculaneum. He sent to the Society of Antiquaries,
in 1777, an interesting account of the discoveries
at Pompeii, which is printed in the fourth volume of the
<i>Archæologia</i>. At Herculaneum he employed, during many
years, Father Antonio <span class='sc'>Piaggi</span> to superintend excavations
and make drawings, and gave him an annual salary equal
to a hundred pounds sterling, after vainly endeavouring—at
that time—to urge on the Neapolitan Government its
own duty to carry on the task in an adequate manner for
the honour of the nation, and to publish the results of the
explorations for the general benefit of learning.</p>

<p class='c029'>Sir William’s services as an ambassador were rendered
with zeal and with credit, as opportunity offered. But the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>opportunity, in his earlier period, was comparatively rare.
It was, perhaps, despite the proverb, not altogether a happy
thing for Naples that its annals were tiresome. The rust
of inactivity showed itself there, as so often elsewhere, to
be much more fatal than the exhaustion of strife. Certainly,
to the ambassador, it was a personal misfortune that,
when the affairs of Naples became really momentous to
Englishmen, the vigour and the will of earlier days were
then departing from the man whose energies were at length
to be put to the test in the proper sphere of his profession.
Meanwhile, and in his prime, he had but—from time to
time—to make routine memorials as to matters of individual
wrong; to heal breaches between one Bourbon and
another; and to secure the neutrality of the Kingdom
of the Two Sicilies during the war which grew out
of the struggle in America. Such matters made no great
inroad upon the pursuits of the naturalist and the antiquarian.</p>

<p class='c029'>Labour on the mountains, in the excavations, and in the
study, had been, now for many years, relieved by congenial
friendships. There had been an improvement in the tone
of Neapolitan Society since <span class='sc'>Hamilton’s</span> first appearance.
And all that was best in Naples had gathered round
him. To English travellers his hospitalities were splendid
and unremitting. But in 1782 the circle lost its
mistress. Seven years before, Sir William and Lady
<span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> had been bereaved of a daughter—their only
child. In 1783 occurred the dreadful earthquake in
Calabria, the greatest calamity of the century save that at
Lisbon.</p>

<p class='c029'>Among the scientific correspondents in England with
whom Sir William <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> kept up an intercourse was
Sir Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span>, then the President of the Royal Society.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>To him was sent the fullest account that was attainable of
the sad event of 1783.</p>

<p class='c029'>It had chanced that just before the news reached Naples,
Sir Joseph had written to <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> about some experiments
and discoveries on the composition and transmutation
of water. He had said, jestingly: ‘In future we philosophers
shall rejoice when an eruption, which may swallow
up a few towns, affords subsistence for as many nations
of animals and vegetables.’ This letter <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> was
about to answer when he received the intelligence from
Calabria.</p>

<p class='c029'>‘We have had here,’ he writes, ‘some shocks of an earthquake
which, in Calabria Ultra, has swallowed up or
destroyed almost every town, together with some towns in
Sicily.... Every hour brings in accounts of fresh
disasters.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1783. Feb. 18.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Some thousands of people will perish with hunger
before the provisions sent from hence can reach them. This,
I believe, will prove to have been the greatest calamity that
has happened in this century. An end is put to the
Carnival.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Hamilton to Banks, MS. <span class='sc'>Addit.</span>, 8967, ff. 34, seqq.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The theatres are shut.
I suppose Saint Januarius
will be brought out.’ There had been no exaggeration
in these first reports. It was found that at Terranova, not
only were all the buildings destroyed, but the very ground
on which they stood sunk to such a depth as to form a sort
of gulf. In that district alone 3043 people lost their lives.
At Seminara 1328 persons were buried beneath the
ruins. In other and adjacent districts more than 3300
persons perished.</p>

<p class='c029'>In 1784 the ambassador visited England. His stay was
brief. But an incident which occurred during this visit
gave its colour to the rest of his life.</p>

<p class='c029'>In 1791 Sir William <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> was made a Privy
Councillor, and in the same year (nine years after the death
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>of his first wife) he married Emma <span class='sc'>Harte</span>, whom he had
first met in the house of his nephew, Colonel <span class='sc'>Greville</span>, in
1784. In September, 1793, his eventful acquaintance with
<span class='sc'>Nelson</span> was formed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Hamilton’s first acquaintance with Nelson.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>In that month, <span class='sc'>Nelson</span> had been sent to Naples with
despatches from Admiral Lord <span class='sc'>Hood</span>, in which Sir William
<span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> was pressed to procure the sending of some
Neapolitan troops to Toulon. After his first interview
with Lord <span class='sc'>Hood’s</span> messenger, he is said to have remarked
to his wife: ‘I have a little man to introduce to you who
will become one of the greatest men England has ever had.’
The favourable impression was reciprocal, it seems. The
ambassador gave such good furtherance to the object of
<span class='sc'>Nelson’s</span> mission, that the messenger, we are told, said to
him, ‘You are a man after my heart.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Clarke and McArthur, <i>Life, &amp;c., of Nelson</i>, vol. i, p. 133; and Nicolas, vol. i, p. 326.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
I’m only a captain,
but, if I live, I shall get to the top of the tree;’ while, of
the too-fascinating lady into whose social circle he was
presently brought, <span class='sc'>Nelson</span> wrote to his wife, ‘She is a young
woman of amiable manners, who does honour to the station
to which she is raised.’ Several years, however, were yet
to intervene before the events of the naval war and the
political circumstances of Naples itself brought about a
close connexion in public transactions between the great
seaman and the British ambassador, whose long diplomatic
career was drawing to its close.</p>

<p class='c035'><span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>, after the manner of Collectors, had scarcely
parted with the fine Museum, which he had sold to the
Public in 1772, before he began to form another. The
explorations of the buried cities gave some favourable opportunities
near home, and his researches were spread far and
wide. In amassing vases he was especially fortunate. And,
in that particular, his second Collection came to surpass the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>first. He became anxious to ensure its preservation in
integrity. With that view he offered it to the King of
Prussia.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Second Hamilton Collection of Vases.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>‘I think,’ he wrote to the Countess of <span class='sc'>Lichtenau</span>, in
May, 1796, ‘my object will be attained by placing my
Collection, with my name attached to it, at Berlin. And I
am persuaded that, in a very few years, the profit which the
arts will derive from such models will greatly exceed the
price of the Collection. The King’s [porcelain] manufactory
would do well to profit by it.... For a long time
past I have had an unlimited commission from the Grand
Duke of Russia [afterwards <span class='sc'>Paul the First</span>], but, between
ourselves, I should think my Collection lost in Russia;
whilst, at Berlin, it would be in the midst of men of
learning and of literary academies.</p>

<p class='c029'>‘There are more,’ he continues, ‘than a thousand vases,
and one half of them figured. If the King listens to your
proposal, he may be assured of having the whole Collection,
and I would further undertake to go, at the end of the war,
to Berlin to arrange them.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sir W. Hamilton to the Countess of Lichtenau, 3 May, 1796.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
On reckoning up my accounts,—I
must speak frankly (<i>il faut que je dise la vérité</i>),—I
find that I shall needs be a loser, unless I receive seven
thousand pounds sterling for this Collection. That is
exactly the sum I received from the English Parliament for
my first Collection....<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c030'><sup>[59]</sup></a> As respects Vases, the second is
far more beautiful and complete than the series in London,
but the latter included also bronzes, gems, and medals.’
But the negotiation thus opened led to no result. And
some of the choicest contents of this second Museum
were eventually lost by shipwreck.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>When the correspondence with Berlin occurred, the
Collector’s health was rapidly failing him. The political
horizon was getting darker and darker. Victorious France
was putting its pressure upon the Neapolitan Government
to accept terms of peace which should exact the exclusion
of British ships from the Neapolitan ports. The ambassador
needed now all the energies for which, but a few years
before, there had been no worthy political employment.
They were fast vanishing; but, to the last, Sir William
exerted himself to the best of his ability. It was his misfortune
that he had now to work, too often, by deputy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The later events at Naples, 1796–1799.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Lady <span class='sc'>Hamilton’s</span> ambitious nature, and her appetite for
political intrigue, when combined with some real ability
and a good deal of reckless unscrupulousness as to the path
by which the object in view might be reached, were dangerous
qualities in such a Court as that of Naples. If, more
than once, they contributed to the attainment of ends which
were eagerly sought by the Government at home, and were
of advantage to the movements of the British fleet, they cost—as
is but too well known—an excessive price at last.
The blame fairly attachable to Sir William <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> is
that of suffering himself to be kept at a post for which
the infirmities of age were rapidly unfitting him. But
there he was to remain during yet four eventful years;
quitting his embassy only when, to all appearance, he was
at the door of death.</p>

<p class='c029'>Between the September of 1793 and that of 1798 <span class='sc'>Nelson</span>
and Sir William <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> met more than once; but their
chief communication was, of course, by letter. When, in
October, 1796, after two victories in quick succession,
<span class='sc'>Nelson</span> lost his hard-won prizes, and narrowly escaped being
taken into a Spanish port, it was to <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> that he wrote
for a certificate of his conduct. And one of the ambassador’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>latest diplomatic achievements was his procuring access
for British ships to Neapolitan ports before the Battle of
the Nile was won.</p>

<p class='c029'>On the very night of that famous first of August, 1798,
Sir William—whilst the distant battle was yet raging—told
<span class='sc'>Nelson</span> of the disappointment which had followed the
rumours, current during many days at Naples, of a defeat
given to the French fleet in the Bay of Alexandretta, and
assured him of his own confidence that the rumours, though
then unfounded, would come true at last. Five weeks
afterwards, he had the satisfaction of sending to London the
first official account of the great victory which he had seen
before with the eye of faith.</p>

<p class='c029'>At Naples the authentic news was received with a joy
which worked like frenzy. When the ambassador first
saw the Queen, after its arrival, she was rushing up and
down the room of audience, and embracing every person
who entered it—man, woman, or child.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sir W. Hamilton to Nelson; Nicolas, vol. iii, p. 72.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He sent to <span class='sc'>Nelson</span>
an account of the universal joy. ‘You have now, indeed,
made yourself immortal,’ was his own greeting. On the
22nd they again met, on board the <i>Vanguard</i>, in the Bay.
On the 21st of the following December Sir William
<span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> accompanied the King and Court of Naples in
their flight to Palermo.</p>

<p class='c029'>The events of 1799 belong rather to history than to
biography. Sir William <span class='sc'>Hamilton’s</span> chief share in them
lay in his exertions to obtain for <span class='sc'>Nelson</span> the large powers
which the King of <span class='sc'>Naples</span> vested in the English Admiral—with
results so mingled. On the 21st of June he embarked
with <span class='sc'>Nelson</span> on board the <i>Foudroyant</i>, and sailed
with the squadron to Naples. In the stormy interview
between <span class='sc'>Nelson</span> and Cardinal <span class='sc'>Ruffo</span>, Sir William acted as
interpreter. In all that followed, he seems to have been
rather a spectator than an actor. At the close of the year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>he joined with <span class='sc'>Nelson</span> in the vain endeavour to induce the
King to return to Naples, while that course was yet open
to him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Departure from Naples.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>On the 10th of June, 1800, Sir William took his final
leave of Naples, which had been his home for thirty-six
years, and where he had mingled in a departed world.
In company with the Queen and three princesses, the
<span class='sc'>Hamiltons</span> sailed in the <i>Foudroyant</i> for Leghorn, on their
way to Vienna. A few days after the embarkation, a
fellow-passenger writes thus: ‘Sir William <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>
appears broken, distressed, and harassed.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Miss Knight to Lady Berry, July 2, 1800.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He says that he
shall die by the way, and he looks so ill that I should not
be surprised if he did.’ When the Admiral struck his flag
(13th July) at Leghorn, the party set out for Vienna.
Between Leghorn and Florence, Sir William’s carriage met
with an overturn, which increased his malady. At Trieste
the physicians were inclined to despair of his life. But he
rallied sufficiently to reach England at last, and the change
from turmoil to rest prolonged his life for two years to
come.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Sir William Hamilton’s last days.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>During the long interval between the acquisition of
the first Hamilton Museum and the return of its Collector
to his country, he had marked his interest in the
national Collection by repeated and valuable gifts. To make
yet one gift more—trivial, but possessing an historical interest—was
one of his last acts. On the 12th of February,
1803, he sent to the British Museum a Commission given
by the famous fisherman of Amalfi to one of his insurrectionary
captains. On the 6th of April Sir William <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>
died, in London. He was buried at Milford Haven.</p>

<p class='c035'>The kindly heart had left many memorials of its quality at
Naples. The ambassador had lost a part of his fortune.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>But many poor dependants, in his old home, enjoyed pensions
from his liberality.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Nelson</span>, when writing to the Queen of the Two Sicilies
upon the death of their common friend, made this remark
on his testamentary arrangements:—‘The good Sir William
did not leave Lady <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> in such comfortable
circumstances as his fortune would have allowed. He has
given it amongst his relations.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Nelson to the Queen of Naples (Nicolas, vol. iv, p. 84).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But she will do honour
to his memory, although every one else of his friends calls
loudly against him on that account.’ This comment, however,
expresses rather a temporary feeling than a wise judgment.
Sir William had settled a jointure of seven hundred
pounds a year upon his widow.</p>

<p class='c029'>During the few months of life that yet remained to the
great seaman himself, the highest encomium known to
his vocabulary was to say, ‘So-and-so was a great friend
of Sir William <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>.’</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The ‘Institute of Egypt;’ and its researches and acquisitions.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>As the British Museum owes one choice portion of its
archæological treasures to the man who was <span class='sc'>Nelson’s</span>
type of friendship, so also it owes—indirectly—another
portion of them to the man who was <span class='sc'>Nelson’s</span> favourite
aversion, and whose very name, in the Admiral’s mind,
served to sum up all that was most detestable. The Battle
of the Nile, and the military operations which followed it in
the after years, would have counted no antiquarian riches
amongst their trophies, but for that ardent love of science
in <span class='sc'>Napoleon</span> which prompted him to plan the ‘Institute of
Egypt’ as an essential part of the Campaign of Egypt.</p>

<p class='c029'>The intention with which the Institute of Egypt was
founded embraced every kind of study and research. The
scholars of whom it was composed included within their
number men of the most varied powers. What they effected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>was fragmentary, and yet their researches, directly or indirectly,
bore much fruit.</p>

<p class='c029'>In the end, the harvest was to France herself none the
less abundant from the fact that <span class='sc'>Nelson’s</span> achievement, and
what grew thereout, set Englishmen and Germans to work
with increased vigour in the same field, and divided some
of the tools.</p>

<p class='c029'>Scarcely had General <span class='sc'>Bonaparte</span> established the military
power of the French Republic in Egypt, before he was
employed in organizing the Institute at Cairo.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1798–1801.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Its declared
object was twofold: (1) the increase and diffusion of
learning in Egypt itself; (2) the examination, study, and
publication, of the monuments of its history and of its
natural phenomena, together with the elucidation and
improvement of the natural and industrial capabilities of
the country.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Mémoires sur l’Egypt</i>, passim.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The Institute was composed of thirty-six
members, and was divided into four sections. The section
with which alone we are here concerned—that of Literature,
Arts, and History—was headed by <span class='sc'>Denon</span>, and
amongst its other members were <span class='sc'>Dutertre</span>, <span class='sc'>Parseval</span>, and
<span class='sc'>Ripault</span>. Its labours began in 1798, and were continued,
with almost unparalleled activity, until the summer of 1801,
when the defeat of <span class='sc'>Belliard</span> near Cairo, and the capitulation
of <span class='sc'>Menou</span> at Alexandria, placed that part of the
collections of the Institute which had not been already
sent to France at the disposal of Lord <span class='sc'>Hutchinson</span>.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Denon</span>, on his return from Upper Egypt to Cairo, said,
with French vivacity, that if the active movements of the
Mamelukes now and then forced an antiquary to become,
in self-defence, a soldier, the antiquary was enabled, by way
of balance and through the good nature and docility of
the French troops, to turn a good many soldiers into antiquaries.
Had it not been for this general sympathy and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>readiness, one can hardly conceive that so much could have
been accomplished, even under the eye of <span class='sc'>Napoleon</span>,
amidst perils so incessant. The <i>Description de l’Egypte</i> is
for France at large, no less than for <span class='sc'>Napoleon</span> and the men
whom he set to work, a monument which might well
obliterate the momentary mortification attendant on the
transfer to London of a part of the treasures of the Institute.
History, ancient or modern, scarcely offers a parallel
instance in which war was made to contribute results so
splendid, both for the progress of science and for the
eventual improvement of the invaded country. To the
labours initiated by <span class='sc'>Napoleon</span>, and partially carried out by
the ‘Institute of Egypt,’ the ablest of the recent rulers of
that land owe some of their best and latest inspirations.
Nor is it a whit less true that the most successful of our
English Egyptologists have followed the track in which
Frenchmen led the way. Such results, indeed, can never
suffice to justify an unprovoked invasion. But they illustrate,
in a marvellous way, how temporary evil is wrought
into enduring good.</p>

<p class='c029'>By the sixteenth article of the Capitulation of Alexandria,
it was provided that the Members of the Institute of Egypt
might carry back with them all instruments of science and
art which they had brought from France, but that all collections
of marbles, manuscripts, and other antiquities,
together with the specimens of natural history and the drawings,
then in the possession of the French, should be regarded
as public property, and become subject to the disposal
of the generals of the allied army.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Convention of Alexandria.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The Convention was made between General <span class='sc'>Menou</span> and
General <span class='sc'>Hope</span>, on the 31st of August, 1801.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1801, August.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Against
this sixteenth article <span class='sc'>Menou</span> made the strongest remonstrances,
but General <span class='sc'>Hope</span> declined to modify it, otherwise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>than by agreeing to make a reference, as to the precise
extent to which it should be carried into actual effect, to
Lord <span class='sc'>Hutchinson</span>, as Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p class='c029'>Between <span class='sc'>Menou</span> and <span class='sc'>Hutchinson</span> there was a long
correspondence. The French General declared that the
Collections, both scientific and archæological, were private,
not public property. The since famous ‘Rosetta stone,’
for example, belonged, he said, to himself. Various members
of the Institute claimed other precious objects; some
alleged, with obvious force of argument, that the care
bestowed on specimens of natural history made them the
property of the collectors and preservers; others threatened
to prefer the destruction or defacement of their collections,
by their own hands, to the giving of them up to the
English army.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Negotiations and Services of Colonel Turner.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The correspondence was followed by several personal
conferences between <span class='sc'>Menou</span> and Colonel (afterwards General)
<span class='sc'>Turner</span>, in order to a compromise. <span class='sc'>Turner</span>, who was
himself a man of distinguished knowledge and accomplishments,
advised Lord <span class='sc'>Hutchinson</span> to insist on the transfer
of the Marbles and Manuscripts, and to yield the natural
history specimens, with some minor objects, to the possessors.
The astute Capitan Pasha had contrived to place
himself in ‘possession’ of one of the most precious of the
marbles—the famous sarcophagus which Dr. <span class='sc'>Clarke</span> so
strenuously contended to be nothing less than the tomb of
<span class='sc'>Alexander</span>—by seizing the ship on board of which the
French had placed it, and he gave Colonel <span class='sc'>Turner</span> almost
as much trouble as <span class='sc'>Menou</span> himself had given.</p>

<p class='c029'>The French soldiers were, as was natural, deeply mortified
when they heard that the captors of Alexandria were to
have the antiquities. Every man of them who had had to
do with their excavation or transport had vindicated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span><span class='sc'>Denon’s</span> eulogy by his pains to protect the sculptures from
harm. Now, their excessive zeal and their national pride
led to an unworthy result. The Rosetta stone was stripped
of the soft cotton cloth and the thick matting in which it
had been sedulously wrapped, and was thrown upon its
face. Other choice antiquities were deprived of their wooden
cases.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Capture of the Rosetta Stone</span>;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When <span class='sc'>Turner</span>, with a detachment of artillerymen
and a strong tumbril, went to the French head-quarters to
receive the Rosetta stone, he had to pass through a lane of
angry Frenchmen who crowded the narrow streets of
Alexandria, and were not sparing in their epithets and sarcasms.
Those artillerymen, too, were the first English
soldiers who entered the city. When Colonel <span class='sc'>Turner</span> had
gotten safely into his hands the stone destined to mark an
era in philology, he returned good for evil. He permitted
some members of the Institute of Egypt to take a cast of
it, which they sent to Paris in lieu of the original.</p>

<p class='c029'>The Rosetta inscription had been found, by the French
explorers, among the ruins of a fortification near the mouth
of the Rosetta branch of the Nile. When they discovered
it the stone was already broken, both at the top and at the
right side. Of its triple inscription, commemorative of the
beginning of the actual and personal reign of <span class='sc'>Ptolemy
Epiphanes</span>—and therefore cut nearly two hundred years
before the Christian era—that in the hieroglyphic or sacred
character had suffered most. The second or enchorial inscription
was also mutilated in its upper portion. The
Greek version was almost entire.</p>

<p class='c029'>The scarcely less famous Alexandrian sarcophagus was
found by the French in the court-yard of a mosque called
the ‘Mosque of St. Athanasius.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>and of the Sarcophagus sometimes called ‘Tomb of Alexander.</span>’<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Of its discovery and state
when found, the following account is given in the <i>Description
de l’Egypte</i>:—A small octagonal building, covered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>with a cupola, had been constructed by the Moslems for
their ablutions, and in this they had placed the sarcophagus
to be used as a bath; piercing it for that purpose with large
holes, but not otherwise injuring it. The sarcophagus is
a monolith of dark-coloured breccia—such as the Italians
call <i>breccia verde d’Egitto</i>—and is completely covered with
hieroglyphics.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Description de l’Egypte</i>, vol. v, pp. 373, seqq.; Plates and Append. (8vo edit.), 1829.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Their number, according to the French
artist by whom impressions in sulphur were taken of the
whole, exceeds 21,700. Dr. <span class='sc'>Clarke’s</span> identification of this
monument as the tomb of Alexander has not been supported
by later Egyptologists.</p>

<p class='c029'>This sarcophagus, with most of the other antiquities, was
sent on board the flagship <i>Madras</i>.

The Rosetta inscription,
Colonel <span class='sc'>Turner</span> embarked, with himself, in the frigate
<i>Egyptienne</i>. His own list of the antiquities thus brought,
in safety, to England runs thus:—(1) An Egyptian sarcophagus,
of green breccia; (2) another, of black granite, from
Cairo; (3) another, of basalt, from Menouf; (4) the hand of
a colossal statue—supposed to be Vulcan—found in the
ruins of Memphis; (5) five fragments of lion-headed statues,
of black granite, from Thebes; (6) a mutilated kneeling statue,
of black granite; (7) two statues, of white marble, from Alexandria—Septimus
Severus and Marcus Aurelius; (8) the
Rosetta stone; (9) a lion-headed statue, from Upper Egypt;
(10) two fragments of lions’ heads, of black granite; (11) a
small kneeling figure, of black granite; (12) five fragments of
lion-headed statues, of black granite; (13) a fragment of a sarcophagus,
of black granite, from Upper Egypt; (14) two small
obelisks, of basalt, with hieroglyphics; (15) a colossal ram’s
head. Nos. 10 to 15 inclusive were all brought from Upper
Egypt. (16) A statue of a woman, sitting, with a model of the
capital of a column of the Temple of Isis at Dendera, between
her feet; (17) a fragment of a lion-headed statue, of black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>granite, from Upper Egypt; (18) a chest of Oriental Manuscripts—sixty-two
in number—in Coptic, Arabic, and Turkish.</p>

<p class='c035'>I have given the more careful detail to this notice of the
archæological results of the capitulation of Alexandria, inasmuch
as a very inaccurate statement of the matter has found
its way into an able and deservedly accredited book.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>See the <i>History of Europe</i>, vol. v, p. 596 (last edition).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Sir
Archibald <span class='sc'>Alison</span>, in his <i>History of Europe</i> (probably from
some misconception of the compromise effected between
General <span class='sc'>Turner</span> and the French Commander-in-Chief),
writes thus:—‘General <span class='sc'>Hutchinson</span>, with a generous regard
for the interests of science and the feelings of these distinguished
persons [the Members of the Institute of Egypt],
agreed to depart from the stipulation and allow these
treasures of art to be forwarded to France. The sarcophagus
of <span class='sc'>Alexander</span>, now in the British Museum, was, however,
retained by the British, and formed the glorious trophy of
their memorable triumph.’</p>

<p class='c029'>General <span class='sc'>Turner’s</span> conspicuous service on this occasion
did not end with the transport into England of the Alexandrian
Collections. Before the Rosetta inscription was, by
the King’s command, placed, together with its companions,
in the British Museum, as their permanent abode, General
<span class='sc'>Turner</span> obtained Lord <span class='sc'>Buckinghamshire’s</span> assent to the
temporary deposit of the stone from Rosetta in the custody of
the Society of Antiquaries, by whose care copies of the inscriptions
were sent to the chief scholars and academies of the Continent,
in order that combined study might be brought to bear,
immediately, upon the contents. This circumstance makes it
all the more honourable to our countryman, Dr. Thomas
<span class='sc'>Young</span>, that by his labours upon the stone a strong impulse
was first given to the progress of hieroglyphical discovery.</p>

<p class='c029'>The accessions from Alexandria served, also, to initiate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>another improvement. When, in 1802, they reached the
Museum, its contents had so increased that the old house
afforded no adequate space for their reception. They had,
like some famous sculptures of much later acquisition, to
be placed in sheds which scarcely preserved them from bad
weather, and were even less adapted to facilitate their
study.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1804, July 2.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Parliamentary
Debates</i>,
vol. ii, col.
901, seqq.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The Trustees made their first application to Parliament
for the enlargement of the Museum Building, ‘in
order to provide suitable room for the preservation of
invaluable monuments of antiquity which had been acquired
by the valour, intrepidity, and skill of our troops in an
expedition seldom equalled in the annals of the country.’
And before presenting their petition they determined that
increased facilities should be given for the admission of the
Public, as soon as they should be enabled to make an adequate
increase in the staff of the establishment.</p>

<p class='c029'>When the extension of the British Museum came first to
be discussed in the House of Commons (somewhat grudgingly
and captiously it must, in truth, be acknowledged),
upon the application of the Trustees, some of their number
were already aware that an accession was likely soon to
accrue through the munificence of a fellow-trustee, which
would make a new and extensive building indispensable.
Charles <span class='sc'>Towneley</span> had already made a Will in virtue of
which—as it stood in 1804—the Towneley Marbles were
devised in trust for the British Museum, on condition that
the Trustees thereof should, ‘within two years from the
time of the testator’s decease, set apart a room or rooms
sufficiently spacious and elegant to exhibit these antiquities
most advantageously to the Public,—such rooms to be
exclusively set apart for the reception and future exhibition
of the antiquities aforesaid.’ Circumstances not foreseen in
1802, when Colonel <span class='sc'>Towneley’s</span> Will had been first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>made, led afterwards to a change in the mode in which his
noble Collection was to be received by the Public. But its
preservation and public accessibility, in one way or other,
had long been resolved upon.</p>

<p class='c035'>The <span class='sc'>Towneleys</span>, of Towneley, rank among the most
ancient and distinguished commoners of Lancashire. They
can trace an honourable descent to a period antecedent to
the Conquest. They have been seated at Towneley from
the twelfth century. Several of them have given good
service to England, in various ways, in spite of the obstacles
and discouragements which, for many generations, clave to
almost every man whose convictions obliged him to adhere
to the Roman Catholic Church, and so to incur the pains
and disabilities of recusancy. Of these they had their full
share. One <span class='sc'>Towneley</span> had been mulcted in fines amounting
to more than five thousand pounds, simply for remaining
true to his belief, and had been, for that cause, sent
(with an ingenuity of torment one is almost tempted to call
diabolic) from prison to prison across the breadth of England,
and back again.<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c030'><sup>[60]</sup></a> Another <span class='sc'>Towneley</span> was driven
into an exile which lasted so long that when he returned
into Lancashire everybody had forgotten his features and
his voice, except his dog. But neither fine, imprisonment,
nor banishment, had converted them to Protestantism.
Hence it was that Charles <span class='sc'>Towneley</span>, the Collector of the
Marbles, received his education at Douay, and contracted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>all the strong formative impressions of early life and habit
on the Continent.</p>

<p class='c029'>He was born, in the old seat of the family at Towneley
Hall, on the 1st of October, 1737.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Life of Charles Towneley.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
His father, William
<span class='sc'>Towneley</span>, had married Cecilia, sole daughter and heir of
Richard <span class='sc'>Standish</span>, by his wife Lady Philippa <span class='sc'>Howard</span>,
daughter of Henry, Duke of <span class='sc'>Norfolk</span>. The hall—which
has not yet lost all its venerable aspect—was built in part
by a Sir John <span class='sc'>Towneley</span> in the reign of <span class='sc'>Henry VIII</span>, and
its older portions (turrets, gateway, chapel, and library)
suit well the fine position of the building, and the noble
woods which back it. Of the founder two things still
remain in local tradition and memory. He took the changes
made under the rule of <span class='sc'>Henry</span>—or rather of Thomas
<span class='sc'>Cromwell</span>—so much in dudgeon, that when Lancaster
Herald came to Towneley, upon his Visitation, he refused
to admit him, saying, ‘Do not trouble thyself. There are
no more gentlemen left in Lancashire now than my Lord of
<span class='sc'>Derby</span>, and my Lord <span class='sc'>Monteagle</span>.’ The other tradition of
this same Sir John is, that he enclosed a common pasture
called Horelaw, and so made the peasantry as angry with
his innovations as he was with <span class='sc'>Cromwell’s</span>. Some of their
descendants may yet chance to assure the inquisitive
stranger, that his ghost still haunts the park, crying aloud
in the dead of night—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>At Douay Charles <span class='sc'>Towneley</span> received a careful education,
moulded, of course, under the conditions and the
memories of that celebrated College. When he left its good
priests he was already the owner of the family estates—his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>father having died prematurely in 1742—and he was
plunged, at once, into the gaieties and temptations of Paris.
All the Mentorship he had was that of a great uncle who had
become sufficiently naturalised to win the friendship of
<span class='sc'>Voltaire</span>, and to be able to turn <i>Hudibras</i> into excellent
French. The dissipations of the Capital overpowered, for a
time, the real love of classical studies which had been excited
in the provincial college. But the seed had been sown
in a good soil. The study of art and of classical archæology,
in particular, presently reasserted its claims and renewed its
attractions. It was a fortunate circumstance, too, that
family affairs required the presence of Mr. <span class='sc'>Towneley</span> in
England on the attainment of his majority.</p>

<p class='c029'>He had left Towneley very young. He came back to it
with more of the foreigner than of the Englishman in his
ways of life and manners. But he was able to win the
genuine regard of his neighbours, and to take his fair share
in their pursuits and sports, although he could never—at
least in his own estimation—succeed in expressing his
thoughts with as much ease and readiness in English as in
French. Late in life, he would speak of this conscious
inability with regret. Whether needfully or not, the feeling,
no doubt, prevented Mr. <span class='sc'>Towneley</span> from turning to literary
account his large acquirements.</p>

<p class='c029'>What he had seen of the Continent had given him a
desire to see more of it, and the bias of his youthful studies
pointed in the same direction. In 1765, after a short stay
in France, he went into Italy, and there he passed almost
eight years. They were passed in a very different way from
that in which he had passed the interval between Douay
and Towneley. That long residence abroad enabled him to
become a very conspicuous benefactor to his country.</p>

<p class='c029'>He visited Naples, Florence, and Rome, and from time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>to time made many excursions into various parts of Magna
Græcia and of Sicily. At Naples he formed the acquaintance
of Sir William <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> and of <span class='sc'>D’Hancarville</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Towneley’s Artistic Researches in Italy.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1765–1778.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
At Rome he became acquainted with three Englishmen,
James <span class='sc'>Byres</span>, Gavin <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>, and Thomas <span class='sc'>Jenkins</span>,
all of whom had first gone thither as artists, and step by
step had come to be almost exclusively engrossed in the
search after works of ancient art. The success and fame
of Sir William <span class='sc'>Hamilton’s</span> researches in the Kingdom of
the Two Sicilies and of those, still earlier, of Thomas <span class='sc'>Coke</span>
of Holkham (afterwards Earl of Leicester), had given a
strong impulse to like researches in other parts of Italy.
<span class='sc'>Towneley</span> caught the contagion, and was backed by large
resources to aid him in the pursuit.</p>

<p class='c029'>His first important purchase was made in 1768. It
was that of a work already famous, and which for more
than a century had been one of the ornaments of the
Barberini Palace at Rome. This statue of a boy playing
at the game of tali, or ‘osselets’ (figured in <i>Ancient Marbles
in the British Museum</i>, part ii, plate 31), was found among
the ruins of the Baths of Titus, during the Pontificate of
<span class='sc'>Urban the Eighth</span>. During the same year, 1768, Mr.
<span class='sc'>Towneley</span> acquired, from the Collection of Victor <span class='sc'>Amadei</span>,
at Rome, the circular urn with figures in high relief—which
is figured in the first volume of Piranesi’s <i>Raccolta di Vasi
Antichi</i>—and also the statue of a <i>Nymph of Diana</i>, seated
on the ground. This statue was found in 1766 at the
Villa Verospi in Rome.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Formation of the Towneley Gallery.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Two years afterwards, several important acquisitions
were made of marbles which were discovered in the course
of the excavations undertaken by <span class='sc'>Byres</span>, Gavin <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Jenkins</span>, amidst the ruins of Hadrian’s Villa near
Tivoli. The joint-stock system, by means of which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>diggings were effected, no less than the conditions which
accompanied the papal concessions that authorised them,
necessitated a wide diffusion of the spoil. But whenever
the making of a desirable acquisition rested merely upon
liberality of purse or a just discrimination of merit, Mr.
<span class='sc'>Towneley</span> was not easily outstripped in the quest. Amongst
these additions of 1769–71 were the noble Head of
<i>Hercules</i>, the Head said, conjecturally, to be that of
<i>Menelaus</i>, and the ‘<i>Castor</i>’ in low relief (all of which are
figured in the second part of <i>Ancient Marbles</i>).</p>

<p class='c029'>Two terminal heads of the bearded <i>Bacchus</i>—both of
them of remarkable beauty—were obtained in 1771 from
the site of Baiæ. These were found by labourers who
were digging a deep trench for the renewal of a vineyard,
and were seen by Mr. <span class='sc'>Adair</span>, who was then making an
excursion from Naples. In the same year the statue of
<i>Ceres</i> and that of a <i>Faun</i> (<i>A. M.</i>, ii, 24) were purchased
from the Collection in the Macarani Palace at Rome. In
1772 the <i>Diana Venatrix</i> and the <i>Bacchus and Ampelus</i>
were found near La Storta. It was by no fault of <span class='sc'>Towneley’s</span>
that the <i>Diana</i> was in part ‘restored,’ and that
blunderingly. He thought restoration to be, in some cases,
permissible; but never deceptively; never when doubt
existed about the missing part. In art, as in life, he clave
to his heraldic motto ‘<i>Tenez le vrai</i>.’</p>

<p class='c029'>In 1771, also, the famous ‘<i>Clytie</i>’—doubtfully so
called—was purchased from the Laurenzano Collection
at Naples.</p>

<p class='c029'>The curious scenic figure on a plinth (<i>A. M.</i>, part x)
together with many minor pieces of sculpture, were found
in the Fonseca Villa on the Cælian Hill in 1773. In the
same year many purchases were made from the Mattei
Collection at Rome. Amongst these are the heads of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span><i>Marcus Aurelius</i> and of <i>Lucius Verus</i>. And it was at this
period that Gavin <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> began his productive researches
amidst the ruins of the villa of Antoninus Pius
at Monte Cagnolo, near the ancient Lanuvium. This
is a spot both memorable and beautiful. The hill lies on
the road between Genzano and Civita Lavinia. It commands
a wide view over Velletri and the sea. To <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>
and his associates it proved one of the richest mines of
ancient art which they had the good fortune to light upon.
Mr. <span class='sc'>Towneley’s</span> share in the spoil of Monte Cagnolo comprised
the group of <i>Victory sacrificing a Bull</i>; the <i>Actæon</i>;
a <i>Faun</i>; a Bacchanalian vase illustrative of the <i>Dionysia</i>;
and several other works of great beauty. The undraped
<i>Venus</i> was found—also by Gavin <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>—at Ostia, in
1775.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The acquisition of the ‘Towneley Venus.’</span></div>

<p class='c029'>In the next year, 1776, Mr. <span class='sc'>Towneley</span> acquired one of
the chiefest glories of his gallery, the <i>Venus</i> with drapery.
This also was found at Ostia, in the ruins of the Baths
of Claudius. But that superb statue would not have left
Rome had not its happy purchaser made, for once, a
venial deflection from the honourable motto just adverted
to. The figure was found in two severed portions, and
care was taken to show them, quite separately, to the
authorities concerned in granting facilities for their removal.
The same excavation yielded to the Towneley Collection
the statue of <i>Thalia</i>. From the Villa Casali on the Esquiline
were obtained the terminal head of <i>Epicurus</i>, and the
bust thought to be that of <i>Domitia</i>. The bust of <i>Sophocles</i>
was found near Genzano; that of <i>Trajan</i>, in the Campagna;
that of <i>Septimius Severus</i>, on the Palatine, and that
of <i>Caracalla</i> on the Esquiline. A curious cylindrical
fountain (figured in <i>A. M.</i>, i, § 10) was found between
Tivoli and Præneste, and the fine representation in low
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>relief of a <i>Bacchanalian procession</i> (<i>Ib.</i>, part ii) at Civita
Vecchia. All these accessions to the Towneley Gallery
accrued in 1775 or 1776.</p>

<p class='c029'>Of the date of the Collector’s first return to England
with his treasures I have found no record.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Towneley Gallery in England.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But it would
seem that nearly all the marbles hitherto enumerated were
brought to England in or before the year 1777. The house,
in London, in which they were first placed was found to be
inadequate to their proper arrangement. Mr. <span class='sc'>Towneley</span>
either built or adapted another house, in Park street, Westminster,
expressly for their reception. Here they were seen
under favourable circumstances as to light and due ordering.
They were made accessible to students with genuine
liberality. And few things gave their owner more pleasure
than to put his store of knowledge, as well as his store of
antiquities, at the service of those who wished to profit by
them. He did so genially, unostentatiously, and with
the discriminating tact which marked the high-bred gentleman,
as well as the enthusiastic Collector.</p>

<p class='c029'>A contemporary critic, very competent to give an opinion
on such a matter, said of Mr. <span class='sc'>Towneley</span>: ‘His learning
and sagacity in explaining works of ancient art was equal
to his taste and judgment in selecting them.’<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c030'><sup>[62]</sup></a> If, in any
point, that eulogy is now open to some modification, the
exception arises from the circumstance that early in life, or,
at least, early in his collectorship, he had imbibed from his
intercourse with <span class='sc'>D’Hancarville</span> somewhat of that writer’s
love for mystical and supersubtle expositions of the symbolism
of the Grecian and Egyptian artists. To <span class='sc'>D’Hancarville</span>,
the least obvious of any two possible expositions of a
subject was always the preferable one. Now and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span><span class='sc'>Towneley</span> would fall into the same vein of recondite elaboration;
as, for example, when he described his figure of an
Egyptian ‘tumbler’ raising himself, upon his arms, from the
back of a tame crocodile, as the ‘Genius of Production.’</p>

<p class='c029'>During the riots of 1780, the Towneley Gallery (like the
National Museum of which it was afterwards to become a
part) was, for some time, in imminent peril. The Collector
himself could have no enemies but those who were infuriated
against his religious faith. Fanaticism and ignorance are
meet allies, little likely to discriminate between a Towneley
Venus and the tawdriest of Madonnas. Threats to destroy
the house in Park Street were heard and reported. Mr.
<span class='sc'>Towneley</span> put his gems and medals in a place of safety,
together with a few other portable works of art. Then,
taking ‘Clytie’ in his arms—with the words ‘I must take
care of my wife’—he left his house, casting one last, longing,
look at the marbles which, as he feared, would never
charm his eyes again. But, happily, both the Towneley
house and the British Museum escaped injury, amid the
destruction of buildings, and of works of art and literature,
in the close neighbourhood of both of them.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Sculptures acquired from the Villa Montalto at Rome</span>;</div>

<p class='c029'>Liberal commissions and constant correspondence with
Italy continued to enrich the Towneley Gallery, from time
to time, after the Collector had made England his own
usual place of abode. In 1786, Mr. <span class='sc'>Jenkins</span>—who had
long established himself as the banker of the English in
Rome, and who continued to make considerable investments
in works of ancient art, with no small amount of
mercantile profit—purchased all the marbles of the Villa
Montalto. From this source Mr. <span class='sc'>Towneley</span> obtained his
<i>Bacchus visiting Icarus</i> (engraved by <span class='sc'>Bartoli</span> almost a
century before); his <i>Bacchus and Silenus</i>; the bust of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span><i>Hadrian</i>; the sarcophagus decorated with a <i>Bacchanalian
procession</i> (<i>A. M.</i>, part x), and also that with a representation
of the <i>Nine Muses</i>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>and from
new Excavations.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
By means of the same keen agent
and explorer he heard, in or about the year 1790, that leave
had been given to make a new excavation under circumstances
of peculiar promise.</p>

<p class='c029'>Our Collector was at Towneley when the letter of Mr.
<span class='sc'>Jenkins</span> came to hand. He knew his correspondent, and
the tenour of the letter induced him to resolve upon an
immediate journey to Rome. The grass did not grow
under his feet. He travelled as rapidly as though he had
been still a youngster, escaping from Douay, with all the
allurements of Paris in his view.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Journey to Rome of 1790?</span></div>

<p class='c029'>When he reached Rome, he learnt that the promising
excavation was but just begun upon. Without any preliminary
visits, or announcement, he quietly presented himself
beside the diggers, and ere long had the satisfaction of
seeing a fine statue of Hercules displayed. Other fine works
afterwards came to light. But on visiting Mr. <span class='sc'>Jenkins</span>,
in order to enjoy a more deliberate examination of ‘the find,’
and to settle the preliminaries of purchase, his enjoyment
was much diminished by the absence of Hercules. <span class='sc'>Jenkins</span>
did not know that his friend had seen it exhumed, and he
carefully concealed it from his view. Eager remonstrance,
however, compelled him to produce the hidden treasure.
<span class='sc'>Towneley</span>, at length, left the banker’s house with the conviction
that the statue was his own, but it never charmed
his sight again until he saw it in the Collection of Lord
<span class='sc'>Lansdowne</span>. He had, however, really secured the <i>Discobolus</i>
or Quoit-thrower,—perhaps, notwithstanding its
restored head, the finest of the known repetitions of
<span class='sc'>Myro’s</span> famous statue,—as well as some minor pieces of
sculpture.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>Other and very valuable acquisitions were made, occasionally,
at the dispersion of the Collections of several lovers
of ancient art, some of these Collections having been
formed before his time, and others contemporaneously with
his own.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Acquisitions made in England and in France.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In this way he acquired whilst in England
(1) the bronze statue of <i>Hercules</i> found, early in the
eighteenth century, at Jebel or Gebail (the ancient Byblos),
carried by an Armenian merchant to Constantinople, there
sold to Dr. <span class='sc'>Swinney</span>, a chaplain to the English factory;
by him brought into England, and purchased by Mr.
James <span class='sc'>Matthews</span>; (2) the Head of <i>Arminius</i>, also from
the Matthews Collection; (3) the <i>Libera</i> found by Gavin
<span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>, on the road to Frascati, in 1776, and then
purchased by Mr. <span class='sc'>Greville</span>; (4) Heads of a <i>Muse</i>, an
<i>Amazon</i>, and some other works, from the Collection of Mr.
Lyde <span class='sc'>Browne</span>, of Wimbledon; (5) the <i>Monument of
Xanthippus</i>, from the Askew Collection; (6) the bust of a
female unknown (called by <span class='sc'>Towneley</span> ‘Athys’) found
near Genzano, in the grounds of the family of <span class='sc'>Cesarini</span>,
and obtained from the Collection of the Duke of <span class='sc'>St.
Albans</span>; (7) many urns, vases, and other antiquities,
partly from the Collection of that Duke and partly from
Sir Charles <span class='sc'>Frederick’s</span> Collection at Esher. The bronze
<i>Apollo</i> was bought in Paris, at the sale, in 1774, of the
Museum formed by M. <span class='sc'>L’Allemand de Choiseul</span>.</p>

<p class='c035'>Some other accessions came to Mr. <span class='sc'>Towneley</span> by gift.
The <i>Tumbler and Crocodile</i>, and the small statue of <i>Pan</i>
(<i>A. M.</i>, pt. x, § 24), were the gift of Lord <span class='sc'>Cawdor</span>. The
<i>Oracle of Apollo</i> was a present from the Duke of <span class='sc'>Bedford</span>.
This accession—in 1804—was the last work which Mr.
<span class='sc'>Towneley</span> had the pleasure of seeing placed in his gallery.
He died in London, on the 3rd of January, 1805.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>He had been made, in 1791, a Trustee of the British
Museum, in the progress of which he took a great interest.
Family circumstances, as it seems, occurred which at last
dictated a change in the original disposition which he had
made of his Collection.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Mr. Towneley’s Will.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Codicil of 22 Dec., 1804.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
By a Codicil, executed only twelve
days before his death, he bequeathed the Collection to his
only brother Edward <span class='sc'>Towneley-Standish</span>, on condition
that a sum of at least four thousand five hundred pounds
should be expended for the erection of a suitable repository
in which the Collection should be arranged and exhibited.
Failing such expenditure by the brother, the Collection was
to go to John <span class='sc'>Towneley</span>, uncle of the Testator. Should
he decline to fulfil the conditions, then the Collection should
go, according to the Testator’s first intent, to the British
Museum.</p>

<p class='c029'>Eventually, it appeared, on an application from the
Museum Trustees, that the heirs were willing to transfer
the Collection to the Public, but that Mr. <span class='sc'>Towneley</span> had
left his estate subject to a mortgage debt of £36,500.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Act of 45 Geo. III.</i><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The
Trustees, therefore, resolved to apply to Parliament for a
grant, and this noble Collection was acquired for the Nation
on the payment of the sum of £20,000, very inadequate,
it need scarcely be added, to its intrinsic worth.</p>

<p class='c029'>Charles <span class='sc'>Towneley</span> possessed considerable skill, both as
a draughtsman and as an engraver. In authorship, his
only public appearance was as the writer of a dissertation
on a relic of antiquity (the ‘Ribchester Helmet’), printed
in the <i>Vetusta Monumenta</i>.</p>

<p class='c029'>He was a learned, genial, and benevolent man. His intense
love of ancient art did not blind his eyes to things
beyond art, and above it. The impulses of the collector
did not obstruct the duties of the citizen. He was a good
landlord; a generous friend. It may be said of him, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>literal truth, that he restricted his personal indulgences in
order that he might the more abundantly minister to the
wants of others.</p>

<p class='c029'>Charles <span class='sc'>Towneley</span> was buried at Burnley. The following
inscription was placed upon his monument:</p>

<p class='c029'>Whilst the Trustees of the British Museum were preparing—in
a way that will be hereafter noticed—for the
reception of this noble addition to the public wealth of the
Nation, another liberal-minded scholar and patriot was
considering in what way his collections in the wide field of
classical archæology might be made most contributive to
the progress of learning, of art, and of public education.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Lord Elgin and his Pursuits in Greece.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Thomas <span class='sc'>Bruce</span>, eleventh Earl of Kincardine, and seventh
Earl of Elgin, was born on the 20th of July, 1766. He
was a younger son, but succeeded to his earldoms on the
death, without issue, in 1771, of his elder brother, William
Robert, sixth Earl of Elgin, and tenth of Kincardine. He
was educated at Harrow, at St. Andrew’s, and at Paris;
entered the army in 1785; and in 1790 began his diplomatic
career by a mission to the Emperor Leopold. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>subsequent years he was sent as Commissioner to the
armies of Prussia and Austria, successively, and was present
during active military operations, both in Germany and in
Flanders. In 1795 he went as envoy to Berlin.</p>

<p class='c035'>Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span> was appointed to the embassy to the
Ottoman Porte, with which his name is now inseparably
connected, in July, 1799. One of his earliest reflections
after receiving his appointment was that the mission to
Constantinople might possibly afford opportunities of promoting
the study and thorough examination of the remains
of Grecian art in the Turkish dominions. He consulted
an early friend, Mr. <span class='sc'>Harrison</span>—distinguished as an architect,
who had spent many years of study on the Continent
with much profit—as to the methods by which any such
opportunities might be turned to fullest account. <span class='sc'>Harrison’s</span>
advice to his lordship was that he should seek permission
to employ artists to make casts, as well as
drawings and careful admeasurements, of the best remaining
examples of Greek architecture and sculpture, and more
especially of those at Athens.</p>

<p class='c029'>Before leaving England, Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span> brought this subject
before the Government. He suggested the public value of
the object sought for, and how worthy of the Nation it
would be to give encouragement from public sources for
the employment of a staff of skilful and eminent artists.
But the suggestion was received with no favour or welcome.
He was still unwilling to relinquish his hopes, and
endeavoured to engage, at his own cost, some competent
draughtsmen and modellers. But the terms of remuneration
proposed to him were beyond his available means.
He feared that he must give up his plans.</p>

<p class='c029'>On reaching Palermo, however, Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span> opened the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>subject to Sir William <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>, who strongly recommended
him to persevere, and told him that if he could
not afford to meet the terms of English artists, he would
find less difficulty in coming to an agreement with Italians,
whose time commonly bore a smaller commercial value.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Confers with Sir William Hamilton.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
With Sir William’s assistance he engaged, in Sicily, a distinguished
painter and archæologist, John Baptist <span class='sc'>Lusieri</span>
(better known at Naples as ‘Don Tita’), and he obtained
several skilful modellers and draughtsmen from Rome.
The removal of the marbles themselves formed no part of
Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin’s</span> original design. That step was induced by
causes which at this time were unforeseen.</p>

<p class='c029'>On his arrival at Constantinople Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span> applied to
the Turkish Ministers for leave to establish six artists at
Athens to make drawings and casts. He met with many
difficulties and delays, but at length succeeded.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Sends Artists to Athens</span>;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Mr.
<span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>, his Secretary, accompanied the Italians into
Greece, to superintend the commencement of their labours.</p>

<p class='c029'>The difficulties at Constantinople proved to be almost
trivial in comparison with those which ensued at Athens.
Every step was met, both by the official persons and the
people generally, with jealousy and obstruction. If a
scaffold was put up, the Turks were sure that it was with a
view to look into the harem of some neighbouring house.
If a fragment of sculpture was examined with any visible
delight or eagerness, they were equally sure that it must
contain hidden gold. When the artist left the specimen
he had been drawing, or modelling, he would find, not infrequently,
that some Turk or other had laid hands upon
it and broken it to pieces. But the artists persevered, and
habit in some degree reconciled, at length, the people to
their presence.</p>

<p class='c029'>When Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span> went himself to Athens the state in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>which he found some of the temples suggested to him the
desirableness of excavations in the adjacent mounds. He
purchased some houses, expressly to pull them down and
to dig beneath and around them. Sometimes the exploration
brought to light valuable sculpture.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>and makes Explorations by digging.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Sometimes,
in situations of greatest promise, nothing was found.</p>

<p class='c029'>On one occasion, when the indication of buried sculpture
seemed conclusive, and yet the search for it fruitless, Lord
<span class='sc'>Elgin</span> was induced to ask the former owner of the ground
if he remembered to have seen any figures there. ‘If you
had asked me that before,’ replied the man, ‘I could have
saved you all your trouble. I found the figures, and
pounded them to make mortar with, because they were of
excellent marble. A great part of the Citadel has been
built with mortar made in the same way. That marble
makes capital lime.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The conversation was not lost upon Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span>. And
the assertion made in it was amply corroborated by facts
which presently came under his own eyes. He became
convinced that when fine sculpture was found it would be
a duty to remove it, if possible, rather than expose it to
certain destruction—a little sooner or a little later—from
Turkish barbarity.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Explorations extended to other parts of Greece.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>At intervals the artists, whose head-quarters were at
Athens, made exploring trips to other parts of Greece.
They visited Delphi, Corinth, Epidaurus, Argos, Mycene,
Cape Sigæum, Olympia, Æginæ, Salamis, and Marathon.</p>

<p class='c029'>But it was only by means of renewed efforts at Constantinople,
and after a long delay, that the artists and their assistant
labourers were enabled to act with freedom and
to make thorough explorations. So long as the French
remained masters of Egypt Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span> had to win every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>little concession piecemeal, and obtained it grudgingly. As
soon as it became apparent that the British Expedition
would be finally successful, the tone of the Turkish government
was entirely altered. They were now eager to satisfy
the Ambassador, and to lay him under obligation.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Influence of the British Victories in Egypt.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Firmauns
were given, which empowered him, not only to make models,
but ‘to take away any pieces of stone from the temples of
the idols with old inscriptions or figures thereon,’ at his
pleasure. Instructions were sent to Athens which had the
effect of making the Acropolis itself a scene of busy and
well-rewarded labour. Theretofore a heavy admission fee
had been exacted at each visit of the draughtsmen or
modellers. Before the close of 1802, more than three
hundred labourers were at work under the direction of
<span class='sc'>Lusieri</span>—with results which are familiar to the world.</p>

<p class='c029'>It is less widely known that, had <span class='sc'>Napoleon’s</span> plans in
Egypt been carried to a prosperous issue, the ‘Elgin Marbles’
would, beyond all doubt, have become French marbles.
When Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin’s</span> operations began, French agents were
actually resident in Athens, awaiting the turn of events
and prepared to profit by it, in the way of resuming the
operations which M. <span class='sc'>de Choiseul Gouffier</span> had long previously
begun.<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c030'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Instances of Turkish Devastation.</span></div>

<div class='sidenote'>1674.</div>

<p class='c029'>The efforts of the British Ambassador became the more
timely and imperative from the fact that no amount of
experience or warning was sufficient to deter the Turks from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>their favourite practice of converting the finest of the Greek
Temples into powder magazines.
Twenty of the metopes
of the northern side of the Parthenon had been, in consequence
of this practice, destroyed by an explosion during
the Venetian siege of Athens in the seventeenth century.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1800.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The Temple of Neptune was found by Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span>
devoted to the same use, at the beginning of the nineteenth.</p>

<p class='c029'>No methods of extending his researches, so as to make
them as nearly exhaustive as the circumstances would admit,
were overlooked by the ambassador. Through the friendship
of the Capitan Pasha, Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span> had already, whilst
yet at the Dardanelles, obtained the famous Boustrophedon
inscription from Cape Sigæum. Through the friendship of
the Archbishop of Athens, he now procured leave to search
the churches and convents of Attica, and the search led to
his possession of many of the minor but very interesting
works of sculpture and architecture which came eventually
to England along with the marbles of the Parthenon.</p>

<p class='c029'>Of the curious range and variety of the dangers to which
the remains of ancient art were exposed under Turkish rule,
the Boustrophedon inscription just mentioned affords an
instance worth noting.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Memoranda on the Earl of Elgin’s Pursuits in Greece, &amp;c.</i>, p. 35.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span> found it in use as a
seat, or couch, at the door of a Greek chapel, to which persons
afflicted with ague or rheumatism were in the habit of
resorting, in order to recline on this marble, which, in their
eyes, possessed a mysterious and curative virtue. The seat
was so placed as to lift the patient into a much purer air
than that which he had been wont to breathe below, and it
commanded a most cheerful sea-view; but it was the ill fate
of the inscription to have a magical fame, instead of the
atmosphere. Constant rubbing had already half obliterated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>its contents. But for Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span>, the whole would soon
have disappeared. At Athens itself, the loftier of the sculptures
in the Acropolis enjoyed equal favour in the eyes of
Turkish marksmen, as affording excellent targets.</p>

<p class='c029'>In the course of various excavations made, not only at
Athens, but at Æginæ, Argos, and Corinth, a large collection
of vases was also formed. It was the first collection
which sufficed, incontestibly, to vindicate the claim of the
Greeks to the invention of that beautiful ware, to which
the name of ‘Etruscan’ was so long and so inaccurately
given.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Ibid.</i>, 31.</div>

<p class='c029'>One of the most interesting of the many minor discoveries
made in the course of Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin’s</span> researches
comprised a large marble vase, five feet in circumference,
which enclosed a bronze vase of thirteen inches diameter.
In this were found a lachrymatory of alabaster and a deposit
of burnt bones, with a myrtle-wreath finely wrought in gold.
This discovery was made in a tumulus on the road
leading from Port Piræus to the Salaminian Ferry and
Eleusis.</p>

<p class='c035'>Early in 1803, all the sculptured marbles from the
Parthenon which it was found practicable to remove were
prepared for embarkation. Both of those so prepared and
of the few that were left, casts had been made, together
with a complete series of drawings to scale. That great
monument of art had been exhaustively studied, with the
aid of all the information that could be gathered from the
drawings made by the French artist, <span class='sc'>Carrey</span>, in 1674,
and those of the English architect, <span class='sc'>Stuart</span>, in 1752. A
general monumental survey of Athens and Attica was also
compiled and illustrated.</p>

<p class='c029'>The original frieze, in low relief, of the <i>cella</i> of the Parthenon—representing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>the chief festive solemnity of Athens,
the Panathenaic procession—had extended, in the whole, to
about five hundred and twenty feet in length. That portion
which eventually reached England amounted to two
hundred and fifty feet. And of this a considerable part was
obtained by excavations. Of a small portion of the remainder
casts were brought. But the bulk of it had been
long before destroyed. Of the statues which adorned the
pediments a large portion had also perished, yet enough
survived to indicate the design and character of the whole.
Of statues and fragments of statues, seventeen were brought
to England. Of metopes in high relief, from the frieze of
the entablature, fourteen were brought.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The difficulties of Transport and the Shipwreck at Cerigo.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Thus far, an almost incredible amount of effort and toil
had been rewarded by a result large enough to dwarf all
previous researches of a like kind. But the difficulties and
dangers of the task were very far from being ended. The
ponderous marbles had to be carried from Athens to the
Piræus. There was neither machinery for lifting, nor appliances
for haulage. There were no roads. The energy,
however, which had wrestled with so many previous obstacles
triumphed over these. But only to encounter new
peril in the shape of a fierce storm at sea.</p>

<p class='c029'>Part of the Elgin Marbles had been at length embarked
in the ship, purchased at Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin’s</span> own cost, in which
Mr. <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> sailed for England, carrying with him also
his drawings and journals. The vessel was wrecked near
Cerigo. Seven cases of sculpture sunk with the ship.
Only four, out of the eleven embarked in the <i>Mentor</i>, were
saved, along with the papers and drawings. Meanwhile,
Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span> himself, on his homeward journey, was, upon
the rupture of the Peace of Amiens, arrested and ‘detained’
in France.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>If the reader will now recall to mind, for an instant, the
mortifications and discouragements, as well as the incessant
toils, which had attended this attempt to give to the whole
body of English artists, archæologists, and students, advantages
which theretofore only a very small and exceptionally
fortunate knot of them could enjoy, or hope to
enjoy, he will, perhaps, incline to think that enough had
been done for honour. The casts and drawings had been
saved. The removal of marbles had formed no part of
Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin’s</span> first design. It was only when proof had
come—plain as the noonday sun—that to remove was to
preserve, and to preserve, not for England alone, but for the
civilised world, that leave to carry away was sought from
the Turkish authorities, and removal resolved upon.</p>

<p class='c029'>Entreaty to the British Government that the thorough
exploration of the Peloponnesus, by the draughtsman and
the modeller, should be made a national object, had been
but so much breath spent in vain. Private resources had
then been lavished, beyond the bounds of prudence, to
confer a public boon. Personal hardships and popular
animosities had been alike met by steady courage and quiet
endurance. All kinds of local obstacle had been conquered.
And now some of the most precious results of so
much toil and outlay lay at the bottom of the sea. The
chief toiler was a prisoner in France.</p>

<p class='c029'>But Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span> was not yet beaten. He came of a
tough race. He was—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c033'>

</div>

<p class='c034'><span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Lord Elgin branded, in England, as a Robber.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The buried marbles were raised, at the cost of two more
years of labour, and after an expenditure, in the long effort,
of nearly five thousand pounds, in addition to the original
loss of the ship. Then a storm of another sort had to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>faced in its turn. A burst of anger, classical and poetical,
declared the ambassador to be, not a benefactor, but a thief.
The gale blew upon him from many points. The author
of the <i>Classical Tour through Italy</i> declared that Lord
<span class='sc'>Elgin’s</span> ‘rapacity is a crime against all ages and all generations;
depriving the Past of the trophies of their genius
and the title-deeds of their fame, the Present of the strongest
inducements to exertion.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Eustace, <i>Classical Tour</i>, p. 269.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>

Pilgrimage</i> declared that, for all time, the spoiler’s name

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'>That the abuse might have variety, as well as vigour, a very
learned Theban broke in with the remark that there was no
need, after all, to make such a stir about the matter. The
much-bruited marbles were of little value, whether in
England or in Greece. If Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span> was, indeed, a
spoiler, he was also an ignoramus. His bepraised sculptures,
instead of belonging to the age of <span class='sc'>Pericles</span>, belonged,
at earliest, to that of <span class='sc'>Hadrian</span>; far from bearing
traces of the hand of <span class='sc'>Phidias</span>, they were, at best, mere
‘architectonic sculptures, the work of many different persons,
some of whom would not have been entitled to the rank of
artists, even in a much less cultivated and fastidious age....
<span class='sc'>Phidias</span> did not work in marble at all.’ These
oracular sentences, and many more of a like cast, were
given to the world under the sanction of the ‘Society of
Dilettanti.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>The equanimity which had stood so many severer tests
did not desert its possessor under a tempest of angry words.
When set at liberty, after a long detention in France, he
resumed his journey. On his eventual arrival in England,
in 1806, he brought with him a valuable collection of gems
and medals, gathered at Constantinople. He also brought
some valuable counsels as to the mode in which he might
best make the Athenian Marbles useful to the progress of
art, obtained in Rome.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Lord Elgin’s Conference with Canova.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>For, at Rome, he had been enabled to show a sample of
his acquisitions to a man who was something more than a
dilettante. ‘These,’ said <span class='sc'>Canova</span>, ‘are the works of the
ablest artists the world has seen.’</p>

<p class='c029'>When consulted on the point whether restoration should,
in any instance, be attempted, the reply of the great Italian
sculptor was in these words: ‘The Parthenon Marbles have
never been retouched. It would be sacrilege in me—sacrilege
in any man—to put a chisel on them.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span> came to England with the intention of offering
his whole Collection to the British Government, unconditionally.
He was ready to forget the short-sightedness with
which his proposal of 1799 had been met. He was prepared
to trust to the liberality of Parliament, and to the
force of public opinion, for the reimbursement of his outlay,
and the fair reward of his toil. The ambassador was not
in a position to sacrifice the large sums of money he had
spent. He could not afford the proud joy of giving to
Britain, entirely at his own cost, a boon such as no man,
before him, had had the power of giving. There were conflicting
duties lying upon him, such as are not to be put
aside. That British artists—in one way or another—should
profit by the grand exemplars of art which he
had saved from Turkish musquetry and the Turkish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>lime-kilns, was the one thing towards which his face was
set.</p>

<p class='c029'>When first imprisoned in France, Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span> did actually
send a direction to England that his Collection should
be made over, unconditionally, to the British Government.
This order was sent, to guard against the possible effect of
any casualty that might happen during his detention, the
duration of which was then very problematical. He reached
England, however, before the instruction had been carried
into effect. In the mean time, the controversy about the
real value of the Marbles, as well as that which impugned
the Collector’s right to remove them from Athens, had
arisen, and had excited public attention. It became important
to elicit an enlightened opinion on those points,
before raising the question how the sculpture should be
finally disposed of.</p>

<p class='c029'>The ignorance of essential facts—which alone made such
reproaches<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c030'><sup>[64]</sup></a> as those I have just quoted possible from a man
devoid of malice, and gifted with genius—was a far less
stubborn obstacle in Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin’s</span> intended path than was
the one-sided learning (one-sided as far as true art and its
appreciation are concerned) which dictated the sneering
utterances of some among the ‘Dilettanti.’ A <span class='sc'>Byron</span>, by
his nature, is open to conviction, sooner or later, in his
own despite. A connoisseur, when narrow and scornful,
is above reason. And he is eminently reproductive.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The action of the Trustees of the British Museum on the Towneley Bequest.</span> 1805–1806.</div>

<p class='c029'>But for this stumbling-block in the path, the time
of Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin’s</span> return to England would have been
eminently favourable for realising his plans in their
fulness.</p>

<p class='c029'>The two important accessions of antiquities to the British
Museum which had just accrued from the success of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>arms in Egypt, and from the almost life-long researches of
Mr. <span class='sc'>Towneley</span> and his associates in Italy, had led the way
to an important enlargement of the Museum building, and
also to a great improvement in its internal organization.
The true importance, to the Public, of a series of the best
works of ancient art as a national possession was beginning
to be felt.</p>

<p class='c029'>In June, 1805, the Trustees obtained from Parliament
the purchase of the Towneley Marbles. They had already
(in the previous year) obtained power to begin an additional
building, the plan and design of which were now enlarged,
and made specially appropriate to the reception and display
of the Towneley Collection.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Organization of the Department of Antiquities.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Hitherto, the Antiquities in the Museum had been regarded
as a mere appendix of the Natural History Collections.
They were now made a separate department, in
accordance with their intrinsic value. Mr. Taylor <span class='sc'>Combe</span>,
who had entered the service of the Trustees, in 1803, as an
assistant librarian, was made first Keeper of the new
department. He filled that office, with much efficiency,
until his death in 1826.</p>

<p class='c029'>The new building or ‘Towneley Gallery’ was opened by
a royal visit on the third of June, 1808. The Queen, the
Prince of Wales, the Dukes of Cumberland and Cambridge,
came to the Museum with a considerable retinue, and were
received, with much ceremony, by a Committee of the
Trustees. The Queen had not visited the Museum for
twenty years past.</p>

<p class='c029'>The Towneley Gallery was erected from the designs of
Mr. <span class='sc'>Saunders</span>, and was admirably adapted to its purpose.
Some of the sculptures have not been seen to quite equal
advantage since its replacement by the existing building.
The addition has now disappeared as entirely as has old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>Montagu House itself, but the reader may see its form and
style by glancing at the small vignette on the title-page of
this volume.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Opening of the Elgin Marbles at Burlington House.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>So favourable an opportunity, however, was for the
present lost. The self-conceit of the cognoscenti strengthened
the too obvious parsimony of Parliament. Lord
<span class='sc'>Elgin</span> made no direct overture to the Government, but
appealed to the great body of artists, of students, and of art
lovers, for their verdict on his labours in Greece and their
product. He arranged his marbles first in his own house
in Park Lane, and afterwards—for the sake of better exhibition—at
Burlington House, in Piccadilly, and threw them
open to public view. The voice of the artists was as the
voice of one man. Some, who were at the top of the tree,
acknowledged a wish that it were possible to begin their
studies over again. Others, who had but begun to climb,
felt their ardour redoubled and their ambition directed to
nobler aims in art than had before been thought of. Not
a few careers, arduous and honourable, took their life-long
colour from what was then seen at Burlington House.
Some of the men most strongly influenced were not what
the world calls successful, but not one of them ended his
career without making England the richer by his work.</p>

<p class='c029'>The eagerness of foreign artists to study the Elgin
Marbles was equal to that of Englishmen. <span class='sc'>Canova</span>, when
on his visit to London in 1815, wrote: ‘I think that I
can never see them often enough. Although my stay must
be extremely short, I dedicate every moment I can spare
to their contemplation. I admire in them the truth of
nature, united to the choice of the finest forms.... I
should feel perfectly satisfied, if I had come to London
only to see them.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>The most accomplished of foreign archæologists were not
less decisive in their testimony. <span class='sc'>Visconti</span>, after seeing and
studying repeatedly a small portion only of the Parthenon
frieze, said of it: ‘This has always seemed to me to be the
most perfect production of the sculptor’s art in its kind.’
When he saw the whole, his delight was unbounded.</p>

<p class='c029'>The Collector was not able to carry out his plan of exhibition,
in any part of it, to the full extent which he had
contemplated.</p>

<p class='c029'>He was anxious that casts of the whole of the extant
sculptures of the Parthenon should be exhibited, in the same
relative situation to the eye of the viewer which they had
originally occupied in the Temple at Athens. He was also
desirous that a public competition of sculptors should be
provided for, in order to a series of comparative restorations
of the perfect work, based upon other casts of its surviving
portions, and wrought in presence of the remains of the
authentic sculpture itself.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Continuance of the labours of Lusieri at Athens, until 1816.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Meanwhile, the chief of the artists employed in the work
of drawing and modelling continued his labours at Athens,
and in its vicinity, for more than twelve years after Lord
<span class='sc'>Elgin’s</span> departure from Constantinople. Between the years
1811 and 1816, inclusive, eighty cases containing sculpture,
casts, drawings, and other works of art, were added to the
Elgin Collection in London.</p>

<p class='c029'>In the year last named, when the question of artistic
value had already been very effectively determined by the
cumulative force of enlightened opinion, a Select Committee
of the House of Commons was at length appointed, to
inquire whether it were expedient that Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin’s</span> Collection
‘should be purchased on behalf of the Public, and, if
so, what price it may be reasonable to allow for the same.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><i>Report on Earl of Elgin’s Collection</i> (1816), p. 8.</div>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>By this Committee it was reported to the House that
‘several of the most eminent artists in this kingdom rate
these marbles in the very first class of ancient art;&#160;...
speak of them with admiration and enthusiasm; and, notwithstanding
their manifold injuries,&#160;... and mutilations,&#160;... consider them as among the finest models and most
exquisite monuments of antiquity.’ It was also reported
that their removal to England had been explicitly authorised
by the Turkish Government.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ib.</i>, p. 16.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The Committee further
recommended their purchase for the Public at the sum of
thirty-five thousand pounds; and that the Earl of <span class='sc'>Elgin</span>
and his heirs (being Earls of Elgin) should be perpetual
Trustees of the British Museum.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ib.</i>, p. 27.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And the Committee expressed,
in conclusion, its hope that the Elgin Marbles might
long serve as models and examples to those who, by knowing
how to revere and appreciate them, may first learn to
imitate, and ultimately to rival them. On the 1st of July,
1816, the Act for effecting the purchase was passed by the
Legislature. I do not know that any one member of the
Society of Dilettanti really regretted the fact. But it is
certain that by a very eminent connoisseur on the Continent
it was much regretted. The King of Bavaria had already
lodged a sum of thirty thousand pounds in an English
banking house, by way of securing a pre-emption, should
the controversy amongst the connoisseurs on this side of the
Channel, of which so much had been heard, lead the British
Parliament eventually to decline the purchase.</p>

<p class='c029'>The nearest estimate that could be formed in 1816 of
Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin’s</span> outlay, from first to last, amounted to upwards
of fifty thousand pounds. And the interest on that
outlay, at subsisting rates, amounted to about twenty-four
thousand pounds. Upon merely commercial principles,
therefore, the mark of honour affixed by Parliament to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>Earldom of Elgin was abundantly earned. By every other
estimate, Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span> had done more than enough to keep
his name, for ever, in the roll of British worthies. And,
as all men know, he had a worthy successor in that honoured
title. The name of <span class='sc'>Elgin</span>, instead of ranking, according
to <span class='sc'>Byron’s</span> prophecy, with that of <span class='sc'>Erostratus</span>, has already
become a name not less revered in the Indies, and in
America, than in Britain itself.</p>

<p class='c035'>For nearly half a century, Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span> was one of the
Representative Peers of Scotland. After his great achievement
was completed, he took but little part in public life. The
most curious incident of his later years was his election as
a Member of the Society of Dilettanti, twenty-five years
after his return from the Levant. The election was made
without his knowledge. When the fact was intimated to
him, he wrote to the Secretary to decline the honour. After
a brief and dignified allusion to his efforts in Greece, he
went on to say:—‘Had it been thought—twenty-five years
ago, or at any reasonable time afterwards—that the same
energy would be considered useful to the Dilettanti Society,
most happy should I have been to contribute every aid in
my power; but such expectation has long since past. I do
not apprehend that I shall be thought fastidious, if I decline
the honour now proposed to me at this my eleventh hour.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The Collector of the Elgin Marbles died in England on
the fourteenth of October, 1841.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Marbles of Phigaleia.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>During the long period which had thus intervened
between the first exhibition to the Public of the sculptures
from the Temple of Minerva and their final acquisition for
the national Museum, an inferior but valuable series of
Greek marbles was obtained from Phigaleia, in Arcadia.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>They were the fruit of the joint researches, in 1812, of the
late eminent architect, Mr. Charles Robert <span class='sc'>Cockerell</span>,
Mr. John <span class='sc'>Foster</span>, Mr. <span class='sc'>Lee</span>, Mr. Charles <span class='sc'>Haller von
Hallerstein</span>, and Mr. James <span class='sc'>Linkh</span>, who, in that year,
had become fellow-travellers in Greece, and partners in the
work of exploration for antiquities.</p>

<p class='c029'>The temple to which these marbles had belonged, and
beneath the ruins of which they were found, stands on a
ridge clothed with oak trees on one of the slopes of Mount
Cotylium. The scenery which surrounds it is of great
beauty. The temple itself has long been a ruin. It was
the work of <span class='sc'>Ictinus</span>, the builder of the Parthenon. One
portion of the frieze of its <i>cella</i> represents the battles of the
Centaurs and the Lapithæ—the subject of the metopes of
the Parthenon entablature. The remaining portion illustrates
another series of mythic contests—that of the Athenians
and the Amazons.</p>

<p class='c029'>The extent of this frieze, in its integrity, was about a
hundred and eight feet in length, by two feet one and a
quarter inches in height. About ninety-six lineal feet were
found, broken into innumerable fragments, but susceptible,
as it proved—by dint of skill and of marvellous patience—of
almost entire reunion, so that no restoration was
needed to bring the subject of the sculpture into perfect
intelligibility.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Excavations on Mount Cotylium.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Cockerell</span>, one of the most active of the explorers
of 1812, had to proceed to Sicily whilst his fellows in the
enterprise carried on the toils of digging and removal. But
it is from his pen that we have a charming little notice of
the progress of the work, and of the amusements which
enlivened it. ‘I regret’ wrote Mr. <span class='sc'>Cockerell</span>, ‘that I was
not of that delightful party at Phigaleia, which amounted
to above fifteen persons. They established themselves, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>three months, on the top of Mount Cotylium—where there
is a grand prospect over nearly all Arcadia—building, round
the Temple, huts covered with boughs of trees, until they
had almost formed a village, which they called Francopolis.
They had frequently fifty or eighty men at work in the
Temple, and a band of Arcadian music was constantly
playing to entertain this numerous assemblage. When
evening put an end to work, dances and songs commenced;
lambs were roasted whole on a long wooden spit; and the
whole scene in such a situation, at such an interesting time,
when, every day, some new and beautiful sculpture was
brought to light, is hardly to be imagined. Apollo must
have wondered at the carousals which disturbed his long
repose, and have thought that his glorious days of old were
returned.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cockerell to ...; printed by Hughes, <i>Travels in Greece</i>, vol. i, p. 194.</div>

<p class='c029'>‘The success of our enterprise,’ continues Mr. <span class='sc'>Cockerell</span>,
‘astonished every one, and in all circumstances connected
with it good fortune attended us.’ One of these
circumstances, however—that of the mixed nationality of
the discoverers—put, it must be added, some difficulty in
the way towards accomplishing an earnest wish, on the
part of the English sharers in the adventure, that England
should be made the final home of the Phigaleian sculptures.
Two Germans, as we have seen, were active partners in the
exploration. A third, Mr. <span class='sc'>Gropius</span>, had likewise some interest
in it. And there was also a more formidable sleeping
partner in the rich digging. <span class='sc'>Vely</span> Pasha had stipulated that
he was to have one half of the marbles discovered, as the
price of his licence to explore. But, very fortunately, one
of the ordinary changes in Turkish policy at Constantinople
removed <span class='sc'>Vely</span> from his government, just at the critical
moment; and so made him anxious to sell his share, and to
facilitate the removal of the spoil. The new Pasha had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>heard of the discoveries, and was hastening to lay hands
upon the whole. But he was too late.</p>

<p class='c029'>The marbles were removed to Zante. The German proprietors
insisted on a public sale by auction. There was
not time to bring the matter before Parliament.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Transfer of the Marbles of Phigaleia to Zante;</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But the
Prince Regent took an active interest in it. With his
sanction, and mainly by the exertions of Mr. W. R.
<span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> (afterwards a zealous Trustee of the British
Museum), some members of the Government authorised the
despatch of Mr. Taylor <span class='sc'>Combe</span> to Zante. By him the
marbles were purchased, at the price of sixty thousand
dollars; but that sum was enhanced by an unfavourable
exchange, so that the actual payment amounted to nineteen
thousand pounds.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>and to England.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It was paid out of the Droits of the
Admiralty,—a fund of questionable origin, and one which
had been many times grossly abused, but which, on this
occasion, subserved a great national advantage.</p>

<p class='c029'>The marbles thus obtained are confessedly inferior to
those of the Parthenon; but they possess great beauty, as
well as great archæological value. Both acquisitions, in
their place, have contributed to increase historic knowledge,
not less conspicuously than to develop artistic power, or to
enlighten critical judgment, both in art and in literature. It
would not be an easy task to estimate to what degree a
mastery of the learning which is to be acquired only from
the marbles of Attica and of Arcadia, and their like, has
tended to make the study of Greek books a living and life-giving
study.</p>

<p class='c029'>To the sculptures brought from Phigaleia into England
in 1815, several missing fragments have been added subsequently.
A peasant living near Paulizza had carried off a
piece of the frieze to decorate, or to hallow, his hut. This fragment
was procured by Mr. Spencer <span class='sc'>Stanhope</span> in 1816.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>The Chevalier <span class='sc'>Bröndsted</span> added other fragments in 1824.
Only one entire slab of the original sculpture is wanting.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Purchase of the second Towneley Collection, 1814.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Almost contemporaneously with the accessions which
came to the Museum as the result of the explorations in
1814 of Mr. <span class='sc'>Cockerell</span> and his fellow-travellers in
Arcadia, a considerable addition was made to the Towneley
Gallery by the purchase of a large series of bronzes, gems,
and drawings, and of a cabinet of coins and medals, both
Greek and Roman, all of which had been formed by the
Collector of the Marbles. These were purchased from Mr.
<span class='sc'>Towneley’s</span> representatives for the sum of eight thousand
two hundred pounds. Among other conspicuous additions,
made from time to time, a few claim special mention. Among
these are the <i>Cupid</i>, acquired from the representatives of
Edmund <span class='sc'>Burke</span>; the <i>Jupiter</i> and <i>Leda</i>, in low relief,
bought of Colonel de <span class='sc'>Bosset</span>; and the <i>Apollo</i>, bought in
Paris, at the sale of the Choiseul Collection.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Minor Antiquities of the Elgin Collection.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Among the minor Greek antiquities which came to the
British Museum in 1816, along with the sculptures of the
Parthenon, are the fine Caryatid figure, and the very beautiful
Ionic capitals, bases, and fragments of shafts, from the
double temple of the Erectheium and Pandrosos at Athens,—part
of which, like the Temple of Neptune, was used by
the Turks, in Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin’s</span> time, as a powder-magazine.
Acquisitions still more valuable than these were the grand
fragment of the colossal <i>Bacchus</i> in feminine attire, which
Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span> brought from the Choragic monument of
Thrasyllus; the statue of <i>Icarus</i> (identified by comparison
with a well-known low-relief in rosso antico formerly preserved
in the Albani Collection); and the noble series of
casts from the frieze of the Theseium and from that of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>Choragic monument of Lysicrates. The Collection also
included many statues’ heads and fragments of great
archæological interest, but of which the original localities
are for the most part unknown, and a considerable series of
sepulchral urns.</p>

<p class='c029'>After the Elgin Marbles, the next important acquisition
in the Department of Antiquities was that made by the purchase,
in 1819, of the famous ‘<i>Apotheosis of Homer</i>.’
This marble had been found, almost two centuries before,
at Frattocchi (the ancient ‘Bovillæ’), about ten miles from
Rome on the Appian road, and had long been counted
among the choicest ornaments of the Colonna Palace. It
cost the Trustees one thousand pounds. Then, in 1825,
came the noble bequest of Mr. Richard Payne <span class='sc'>Knight</span>.</p>

<p class='c029'>When the treasures of Mr. Payne <span class='sc'>Knight</span> came to be
added to the several Collections made, during the preceding
fifty years, by <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>, <span class='sc'>Towneley</span>, and <span class='sc'>Elgin</span>, as well
as to those which the British army had won in Egypt, or
which were due, in the main, to the research and energy of
our travelling fellow-countrymen, the national storehouse
may fairly be said to have passed from its nonage into
maturity. The Elgin Collection had, of itself, sufficed to
lift the British Museum into the first rank among its peers.
But the antiquarian treasures of the Museum showed many
gaps. Some important additions, indeed, had been made,
from time to time, to the class of Egyptian antiquities.
And a small foundation had been laid of what is now
the superb Assyrian Gallery. Rich in certain classes of
archæology, it remained, nevertheless, poor in certain
others. In 1825, it came to the front in all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Life, Writings, and Collections, of R. Payne Knight.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Richard Payne <span class='sc'>Knight</span> is one of the many men who, in
all probability, would have attained more eminent and
enduring distinction had he been less impetuous and more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>concentrated in its pursuit. He went in for all the honours.
He aimed to be conspicuous, at once, as archæologist and
philosopher, critic and poet, politician and dictator-general
in matters of art and of taste. He was ready to give judgment,
at any moment, and without appeal, whether the
question at issue concerned the decoration of a landscape,
the summing-up of the achievement of a <span class='sc'>Homer</span>, or a
<span class='sc'>Phidias</span>, or the system of the universe.</p>

<p class='c029'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Knight</span> was born in 1749, and was the son of a
landed man, of good property, whose estates were chiefly in
Wiltshire, and who possessed a borough ‘interest’ in Ludlow.
His constitution was so weakly, and his chance of
attaining manhood seemed so doubtful, that his father would
not allow him to go to any school, or to be put to much
study at home. It was only after his father’s death, and
when he had entered his fourteenth year, that his education
can be said to have begun. Within three years of his first
appearance in any sort of school, he went into Italy; substituting
for the university the grand tour. Only when he
was approaching eighteen years of age did he fairly set to
work to learn Greek. But he studied it with a will, and to
good purpose.</p>

<p class='c029'>After remaining on the Continent about six or seven
years, Mr. Payne <span class='sc'>Knight</span> removed to England, and went
to live at Downton Castle. He took delight in the management
of his land, proved himself to be a kind landlord as
well as a skilful one, and convinced his neighbours that a
man might love Greek and yet ride well to hounds. When
returned to Parliament for the neighbouring borough, he
attached himself to the Whigs, and more particularly to
that section of them who supported <span class='sc'>Burke</span> in his demands
for economical reform. When in London, he gave constant
attention to his parliamentary duty, and when in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>country, foxhunting, hospitality, and the improvement of
his estate, had their fair share of his time. But, at all
periods of life, his love of reading was insatiable. When
there was no hunting and no urgent business, he could read
for ten hours at a stretch.</p>

<p class='c029'>He had reached his thirty-sixth year before he made the
first beginning of his museum of antiquities. The primitive
acquisition was a head, unknown—probably of <i>Diomede</i>—which
was discovered at Rome in 1785. It is in
brass, of early Greek work, and was bought of <span class='sc'>Jenkins</span>.
Despite the doubt which exists as to the personage, there are
many known copies of this fine head upon ancient pastes
and gems. In the following year, Mr. <span class='sc'>Knight</span> made his
first appearance as an author.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Early Writings of Mr. Payne Knight.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The <i>Inquiry into the remains of the Worship of Priapus,
as existing at Isernia, in the Kingdom of Naples</i>, treated of
a subject which scarcely any one will now think to have
been well chosen, as the first fruits or earnest of a scholarly
career. When a French critic said of it ‘a maiden-work,
but little virgin-like (<i>peu virginal</i>)’ he expressed, pithily,
the usual opinion of the very small circle of readers at home
to whom the book became known. The author eventually
called in the impression, so far as lay in his power, and the
book is now one of the many ‘rarities’ which might well
be still more rare than they are.</p>

<p class='c029'>In 1791, he gave to the world another work on a classical
subject which possessed real value, and, amongst scholars,
attracted much attention. The <i>Analytical Essay on the
Greek Alphabet</i> is a treatise which, in its day, rendered
good service to grammatical learning, and led to more. It
was followed, in 1794, by <i>The Landscape, a Poem</i>.</p>

<p class='c029'>‘The Landscape’ is an elaborate protest against the then
fashionable modes of gardening, which sought to ‘improve’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>nature, almost as much by replacement as by selection. On
many points the poem is marked by good sense and just
thought, as well as by vigour of expression, but its reasoning
is far superior to its poetry. What is said of the choice
and growth of trees shows thorough knowledge of the
subject and true taste. But it needs no poet to convict
‘Capability <span class='sc'>Brown</span>’ of ignorance in his own pursuit when
he insisted on ‘the careful removal of every token of decay’
as a cardinal maxim in landscape-gardening. Such topics
may well be left to plain prose.</p>

<p class='c029'>The one notable feature in the poem which has still an
interest is its curious indication of that peculiarity in Mr.
<span class='sc'>Knight’s</span> creed which asserted—in relation both to the
works of nature and to those of art—that beauty is absolutely
inconsistent with vastness. The excessive love of
the minute and delicate led Mr. <span class='sc'>Knight</span> into the greatest
practical error of his public life, as will be seen presently.
At this time it merely led him to the bold assertion that no
mountain ought to dare to lift its head so high as to—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c033'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Shame the high-spreading oak, or lofty tower.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'>The lines which follow are, it will be seen, curiously prophetic
of that controversy about the Marbles of the Parthenon
in which Mr. Payne <span class='sc'>Knight</span> took so large a share:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c033'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘But as vain painters, destitute of skill,</div>
      <div class='line'>Large sheets of canvas with large figures fill,</div>
      <div class='line'>And think with shapes gigantic to supply</div>
      <div class='line'>Grandeur of form, and grace of symmetry,</div>
      <div class='line'>So the rude gazer ever thinks to find</div>
      <div class='line'>The view sublime, when vast and undefined.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
 <div class='line c002'>’Tis form, not magnitude, adorns the scene.</div>
      <div class='line'>A hillock may be grand, and the vast Andes mean.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
 <div class='line c002'>Oft have I heard the silly traveller boast</div>
      <div class='line'>The grandeur of Ontario’s endless coast;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>Where, far as he could dart his wandering eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>He nought but boundless water could descry.</div>
      <div class='line'>With equal reason, Keswick’s favoured pool</div>
      <div class='line'>Is made the theme of every wondering fool.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c029'>Within a few months, this poem—little as it is now remembered—went
through two editions. It was soon followed
by a more ambitious flight. In 1796, its author published
‘<i>The Progress of Civil Society; a didactic poem</i>.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The impression which had been made, in that day of
feeble verse (as far as the southern part of the realm is
concerned), by <i>The Landscape</i>, gained for <i>The Progress of
Civil Society</i> an amount of attention of which it was intrinsically
unworthy. The work deals with social progress,
and it treats the convictions dearest to Christian men as
being simply the conjectures of ‘presumptuous ignorance.’
It is the work of a man who writes after nine generations
of his ancestors and countrymen have had a free and open
Bible in their hands, and who none the less puts the worship
of Nature, and of her copyists, in the place of the
worship of Nature’s God. This ‘didactic poem’ is written
in the land of <span class='sc'>Bacon</span>, <span class='sc'>Milton</span>, and <span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>, and it
bases itself on the ‘fifth book of <span class='sc'>Lucretius</span>.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Not the least curious thing about the matter is the effect
which was wrought by Mr. <span class='sc'>Knight’s</span> poetic flight upon
the mind of a brother antiquarian. The work absolutely
inspired Horace <span class='sc'>Walpole</span> with a serious and deep regret
that he was consciously too near the grave to undertake the
defence of Christian philosophy against its new assailant.
Such a labour, from such a pen, would indeed have been a
curiosity of literature.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Horace Walpole on the ‘Progress of Civil Society,’ 1796.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>Feeling that for a man who was almost an octogenarian
the tasks of controversy would be too much, <span class='sc'>Walpole</span>
writes to <span class='sc'>Mason</span>. He entreats him to expose the daring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>poetaster. His earnestness in the matter approaches passion.
‘I could not, without using too many words,’ he says, ‘express
to you how much I am offended and disgusted by
Mr. <span class='sc'>Knight’s</span> new, insolent, and self-conceited poem.
Considering to what height he dares to carry his insolent
attack, it might be sufficient to lump [together] all the rest
of his impertinent sallies&#160;... as trifling peccadillos.... The
vanity of supposing that his authority—the authority of a
trumpery prosaic poetaster—was sufficient to re-establish
the superannuated atheism of <span class='sc'>Lucretius</span>!... I cannot
engage in an open war with him.... Weak and broken
as I am, tottering to the grave at some months past seventy-eight,
I have not spirits or courage enough to tap a paper war.’</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='sc'>Walpole</span> then adverts to a foregone thought, on <span class='sc'>Mason’s</span>
part, to have taken up the foils on the appearance of <i>The
Landscape</i>. ‘I ardently wish,’ he says, ‘you had overturned
and expelled out of gardens this new Priapus, who
is only fit to be erected in the Palais de l’Egalité.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Horace Walpole to William Mason, March 22, 1796 (<i>Letters</i>; Coll. Edit., vol. ix, p. 462).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And
he urges his correspondent not to let the present occasion
slip. Irony and ridicule, he thinks, would be weapons
quite sufficient to overthrow this ‘Knight of the Brazen
Milk-Pot.’</p>

<p class='c029'>The last thrust was unkind indeed. It was hard that
our Collector, whatever his other demerits, should be reproached
for his passion to gather small bronzes, by the
builder and furnisher of Strawberry-Hill.</p>

<p class='c029'>For, amidst all his devotion to poetry and pantheism,
Mr. <span class='sc'>Knight</span> carried on the pursuits of connoisseurship
with insatiable ardour.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Spec. of Ancient Sculp.</i>, pl. 55 and 56.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Among the choicer acquisitions
which speedily followed the <i>Diomede</i>[?] purchased in 1785,
were the mystical <i>Bacchus</i>—a bronze of the Macedonian
period—found near Aquila in 1775; a colossal head of
<i>Minerva</i>, found near Rome by Gavin <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>; and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>figure of <i>Mercury</i> of great beauty. The last-named bronze
had been found, in 1732, at Pierre-Luisit, in the Pays de
Bugey and diocese of Lyons.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Ib.</i>, 33, 34.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
A dry rock had sheltered
the little figure from injury, so that it retained the perfection
of its form, as if it had but just left the sculptor’s
hand. It passed through the hands of three French owners
in succession before it was sold to Mr. <span class='sc'>Knight</span>, by the last
of them, at the beginning of the Reign of Terror.</p>

<p class='c029'>The year 1792, in which he acquired this much-prized
‘Mercury,’ is also the date of a remarkable discovery of no
less than nineteen choice bronzes in one hoard, at Paramythia,
in Epirus. They had, in all probability, been buried
during nearly two thousand years. The story of the find
is, in itself, curious.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The hoard of Bronzes found at Paramythia, in Epirus.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It shows too, in relief, the energy and
perseverance which Mr. <span class='sc'>Knight</span> brought to his work of
collectorship, and in which he was so much better employed—both
for himself and for his country—than in philosophising
upon human progress, from the standpoint of
<span class='sc'>Lucretius</span>.</p>

<p class='c029'>Some incident or other of the weather had disclosed
appearances which led, fortuitously, to a search of the
ground into which these bronzes had been cast—perhaps
during the invasion of Epirus, <i>B.C.</i> 167—and, by the
finder, they were looked upon as so much saleable metal.
Bought, as old brass, by a coppersmith of Joannina, they
presently caught the eye of a Greek merchant, who called
to mind that he had seen similar figures shown as treasures
in a museum at Moscow. He made the purchase, and sent
part of it, on speculation, to St. Petersburgh. The receiver
brought them to the knowledge of the Empress <span class='sc'>Catherine</span>,
who intimated that she would buy, but died before the
acquisition was paid for. They were then shared, it seems,
between a Polish connoisseur and a Russian dealer. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>bronze was brought to London by a Greek dragoman and
shown to Mr. <span class='sc'>Knight</span>, who eagerly secured it, heard the
story of the discovery, and sent an agent into Russia, who
succeeded in obtaining nine or ten of the sculptures found
at Paramythia. Two others were given to Mr. <span class='sc'>Knight</span> by
Lord <span class='sc'>Aberdeen</span>, who had met with them in his travels.
They were all of early Greek work. Amongst them are
figures of <i>Serapis</i>, of <i>Apollo Didymæus</i>, of <i>Jupiter</i>, and of
one of the <i>Sons of Leda</i>. All these have been engraved
among the <i>Specimens of Ancient Sculpture</i>, published by
the Society of Dilettanti.</p>

<p class='c029'>Few sources of acquisition within the limits which he had
laid down for himself escaped Mr. Payne <span class='sc'>Knight’s</span>
research. He kept up an active correspondence with
explorers and dealers. He watched Continental sales, and
explored the shops of London brokers, with like assiduity.
Coins, medals, and gems, shared with bronzes, and with
the original drawings of the great masters of painting, in
his affectionate pursuit.</p>

<p class='c029'>In his search for bronzes he welcomed choice and characteristic
works from Egypt and from Etruria, as well as
the consummate works of Greek genius. His numismatic
cabinet was also comprehensive, but its Greek coins were
pre-eminent. For works in marble he had so little relish
that he actually persuaded himself, by degrees, that the
greatest artists of antiquity rarely ‘condescended’ to touch
marble. But he collected a small number of busts in that
material.</p>

<p class='c029'>For one volume of drawings by <span class='sc'>Claude</span>, Mr. <span class='sc'>Knight</span>
gave the sum of sixteen hundred pounds.</p>

<p class='c029'>Among his later acquisitions of sculpture in brass was
the very beautiful <i>Mars</i> in Homeric armour. This figure
was brought to England by Major <span class='sc'>Blagrave</span> in 1813. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span><i>Bacchic Mask</i> (No. 35, in the second volume of the <i>Specimens</i>)
was found, in the year 1674, near Nimeguen, in a
stone coffin. It was preserved by the Jesuits of Lyons, in
their Collegiate Museum, until their dissolution. From them
it passed into the possession of Mr. Roger <span class='sc'>Wilbraham</span>,
from whom Mr. <span class='sc'>Knight</span> obtained it.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Inquiry into the Symbolism of Greek Art and Mythology.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>On the thorough study of the fine Collection which had
been gathered from so many sources—here indicated by but
a scanty sample—and on that of other choice Collections
both at home and abroad, Mr. <span class='sc'>Knight</span> based the most
elaborate—perhaps the most valuable—work of his life, next
to his Museum itself. The <i>Inquiry into the Symbolism of
Greek Art and Mythology</i> bears, indeed, too many traces of
the narrowness of the author’s range of thought, whenever
he leaves the purely artistic criticism of which he was,
despite his limitations, a master, in order to dissertate on
the interdependence or on the ‘priestcraft’ of the religions of
the world. But his genuine lore cannot be concealed by his
flimsy philosophy. The student will gain from the <i>Inquiry</i>
real knowledge about ancient art. He will find, indeed,
not a few statements which the author himself would be
the first to modify in the light of the new information of
the last fifty years. But he will also find much which, in
its time, proved to be suggestive and fruitful to other
minds, and which prepared the way for wider and deeper
studies. It may do so yet. The book is one which the
student of archæology cannot afford to overlook. Whilst
he may well afford a passing smile at the philosophic insight
which prompted our author’s eulogies (1) upon the
‘liberal and humane spirit which still prevails among those
nations whose religion is founded upon the principle of
emanations;’ (2) upon the wisdom of the ‘Siamese, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>shun disputes, and believe that almost all religions are good;’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><i>Inquiry</i>, &amp;c., p. 19.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
(3) on the supreme fitness of the idolatries of India ‘to call
forth the ideal perfections of art, by expanding and exalting
the imagination of the artist;’ or (4) upon the exceptional
and pre-eminent capacity of the Hindoos to become ‘the
most virtuous and happy of the human race,’ but for that
one solitary misfortune which cursed them with a
priesthood.<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c030'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Dissertation on Ancient Sculpture.</span></div>

<p class='c029'>The <i>Inquiry into Symbolism</i> was, at first, printed only for
private circulation, in 1818. It was afterwards reprinted in
the <i>Classical Journal</i>, with some corrections by the author.
It was again reprinted, after his death, as an appendix
to the second volume of the <i>Specimens of Ancient Sculpture</i>.</p>

<p class='c029'>To the first volume of that work Mr. Payne <span class='sc'>Knight</span>
had already prefixed his <i>Preliminary Dissertation on the
Progress of Ancient Sculpture</i>. After showing that of
Phœnician art we have no real knowledge other than that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>which is to be derived from the study of coins, and that
thence it may be learnt that the Phœnicians had artisans,
but not artists, he goes on to survey Greek art in its successive
phases. That art, at its best, finds, he thinks, a
typical expression, or summary, in the saying ascribed to
<span class='sc'>Lysippus</span>: ‘It is for the sculptor to represent men as they
seem to be, not as they really are.’ He dates the culmination
of Greek sculpture as ranging between the years
<i>B.C.</i> 450 and 400, and as due to the national pride and
energy which were excited by the defeat of <span class='sc'>Xerxes</span> and the
events which followed. He thinks that what was gained,
by the artists of the next half-century, in ideal grace, and in

by a loss of energy, of characteristic expression, and of
originality—the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εθος</span> of art. In the works of <span class='sc'>Lysippus</span>
and his school (<i>B.C.</i> 350–300), he sees a brief resuscitation
of the vigour of the former period, combined with
much more than the grace of the latter, to be followed only
too swiftly by those desolating wars ‘in which the temples
were destroyed, their treasures of art pillaged, and
artists, for the first time, saw their works perish before
themselves.’</p>

<p class='c029'>In the ‘<i>Dissertation</i>,’ as in the ‘<i>Inquiry</i>,’ there are many
statements and many reasonings to which subsequent discoveries
have brought a tacit correction.

The passage in
the former about the Elgin Marbles had to be corrected by
the evidence of the author’s own eyesight. His examination
before the Commons’ Committee of 1816 was an amusing
scene. The key-note was struck by the witness’s first
words. To the question ‘Have you seen the marbles
brought to England by Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span>?’ he replied, ‘Yes. I
have looked them over.’ But on this point, enough has
been said already in a previous page.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>Both to the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> and to the <i>Classical
Journal</i> Mr. <span class='sc'>Knight</span> was a frequent and valuable contributor.
It was in the latter periodical that his Prolegomena

printed a small edition (limited to fifty copies) for private
circulation, as early as in the year 1808.<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c030'><sup>[66]</sup></a> His latest poetical

<p class='c029'>Richard Payne <span class='sc'>Knight</span> died on the twenty-fourth of
April, 1824, in the 75th year of his age. He bequeathed his
whole Collections to the British Museum, of which he had
long been a zealous and faithful Trustee. He made no conditions,
other than that his gift should be commemorated
by the addition to the Trust of a perpetual <span class='sc'>Knight</span>
‘Family Trustee.’</p>

<p class='c029'>For this purpose a Bill was introduced into Parliament by
Lord <span class='sc'>Colchester</span> on the eighth of June. It received the

<p class='c029'>The addition of Mr. <span class='sc'>Knight’s</span> Greek Coins made the
British Museum superior, in that department, to the Royal
Museum of Paris; the addition of his bronzes raised it
above the famous Museum of Naples. By the most competent
judges it has been estimated that, if the Collection
had been sold by public auction, Mr. <span class='sc'>Knight’s</span> representatives
would probably have obtained for it the sum of
sixty thousand pounds.</p>

whether it be more expedient to suppress Popish Practices, &amp;c.</i>, published
in the <i>Cottoni Posthuma</i>, by James Howell, we should have to add
that ‘he travelled on the Continent and passed many months in Italy.’
But that tract is <i>not</i> Cotton’s—though ascribed to him by so able and
careful an historian as Mr. S. R. Gardiner (<i>Archæologia</i>, vol. xli. Comp.
<i>Prince Charles and the Spanish Marriage, &amp;c.</i>, vol. i, p. 32). That its real
author was in Italy is plain, from his own statement ‘I remember that
in Italy it was often told me,’ &amp;c.; and, again: ‘In Rome itself I have
heard the English fugitive taxed,’ &amp;c., <i>Posthuma</i>, pp. 126, seqq. Dr.
Thomas Smith put a question as to this implied visit of Sir Robert to
Italy to his grandson, Sir John Cotton, who assured him that no such
visit was known to any of the family; by all of whom it was believed that
their eminent antiquary never set foot out of Britain. Smith’s words
are these:—</p>

Chamberlain’s letters to Carleton (April, 1612) that ‘Sir Robert Cotton
was sent out of the way’ at a time when certain claims of the Baronets
were to be definitively heard at the Council Board, ‘in order that he
might not produce records in their favour,’ rests on mere rumour.
Charles, Lancaster Herald, wrote to Cotton immediately before the
hearing in these terms: ‘On Saturday next the final determination is
expected, if some troublesome spirit do not hinder; which end I wish
were well made, and am glad that you are not seen in it at this time.’—Cotton

<p class='c029'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. Mr. S. R. Gardiner. His account is contained in the able paper
entitled <i>On Certain Letters of the Count of Gondomar giving an Account of
the Affair of the Earl of Somerset</i>, read to the Society of Antiquaries in
1867. Comp. the same historian’s <i>Prince Charles and the Spanish Marriage</i>
(Vol. I, c. 1, and especially the passage beginning ‘Sarmiento was <i>surprised
by a visit from Sir Robert Cotton</i>,’ and so on). In these pages I
use Sarmiento’s subsequent title of ‘Gondomar,’ simply because English
readers are more familiar with it than with the Spaniard’s family name.
Mr. Gardiner needlessly deepens the stain on Cotton’s memory, arising—all
allowance duly made—out of this intercourse with Gondomar, by
the remark that ‘twenty months before’ the interview occurred, Sir
Robert had ‘argued his case’ [<i>i. e.</i> a tract on the question of the right
treatment, by the State, of Romanist priests and recusants] ‘from a
decidedly Protestant point of view, and had taken care to put himself
forward as a thorough, if not an extreme, Protestant.’ But, unfortunately
for Mr. Gardiner’s trenchant conclusion on that point, the
pamphlet he refers to—by whomsoever written—was certainly <i>not</i>
written by Sir Robert Cotton.</p>

The Spanish Ambassador came to his house pretending [a desire] to see
his rarities. On the 10th of February he acquainted His Majesty with it.
Somerset [had] warrant then to sound the life of the intention.
[Gondomar] told him he doubted he had no warrant to set any such
thing on foot. [On the] 16th of March the Spanish Ambassador dealt
with him and endeavoured to make Somerset Spanish, and to further
this match. [He] answered him that there were divers rubs and difficulties
in it. [On the] 9th of April he gave [Gondomar] a pill in a
paper—viz. three reasons: If the King of Spain would not urge unreasonable
things in Religion, then,’ &amp;c. [as in Gondomar’s letter, which I
have already quoted]. ‘Afterwards Sir Robert Cotton was questioned
[for shewing] to the Ambassador of Spain a packet [received] from
Spain.... [In the year] 1616, His Majesty told Sir Robert
Cotton that Gondomar had counterfeited those letters, and that he was
a “juggling jack.”’ Here Sir Edward Coke interposed. He was one of
the Managers of the Conference for the Commons. He spoke thus:
‘This matter has a little relation to me. I committed Sir Robert
Cotton, when I was Chief Justice. For I understood he had intelligence
with the Spanish Ambassador, and questioned him for it. <i>For no subject
ought to converse with Ambassadors without the King’s leave.</i> For the
offence [for which] I committed him [Sir Robert had] afterwards his
general pardon from the King.’ <i>Journals of the House of Commons</i>, 4

<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c029'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. On this point, it is my wish to leave the reader to form his own
estimate of probabilities. <i>Probabilities</i>, only, are attainable; and I have
no side to take, in any attempt to weigh them. But it may be well to
ask the reader’s attention to a passage in the Diary of a contemporary
of Sir R. Cotton, a man of high character, and one who sat by Cotton’s
side in Parliament, fighting with him for the liberties of England, during
many years; one who is also remarkable for speaking about the faults
of his friends with abundant candour. ‘Sir Robert Cotton, being highly
esteemed by the Earl of Somerset,&#160;... <i>was acquainted with this murder
[of Overbury] by him, a little before it now came to light</i>, and had advised
him what he took to be the best course for his safety.’ This passage
occurs in the private diary of Sir Symonds D’Ewes—‘a man,’ says a
great writer, ‘of somewhat Grandisonian ways,’ a man of ‘scrupulous
Puritan integrity, of high flown conscientiousness,&#160;... ambitious to be
the pink of Christian country gentlemen,’ (Carlyle’s <i>Essays</i>, iv, 297.)
This ‘scrupulous Puritan’ knew all that was current about the terrible
‘Great Oyer of Poisoning,’ as Sir Edward Coke called it. He lived in
familiar intercourse with Cotton, and regarded their long acquaintance as
an honour to himself; whilst speaking freely about certain social habits
and limitations—neither Grandisonian or Puritanic—on Cotton’s part,
as precluding their intercourse from ripening into that close friendship
which such a man as D’Ewes could form only with men likeminded
with himself on the highest interests of humanity. Is it not easy to
infer—and is not the inference also inevitable—that by the fact of
Somerset ‘acquainting Cotton with the murder of Overbury a little
before’ it became public, and advising him as to ‘the course for his
safety,’ D’Ewes understood such a communication and such advice as
are entirely compatible with Somerset’s innocence of his wife’s crime?</p>

told me, he proceeded; leaving the rest to be added&#160;... according to

the following passage occurs. The writer is Richard James, who for
very many years was Librarian to Sir Robert Cotton, and he is writing
to Secretary Lord Dorchester.—‘About July last, I was willed by Sir
Robert Cotton to carry him [Mr. Oliver Saint John] into the Upper
Study and there let him make search among some bundles of papers for
business of the Sewers.... If he (St. John) did make any mention of a
projecting pamphlet there pretended to be found, so God save me as I
entered into no further conversation of it. Neither can I believe that any
such as this now questioned was ever in keeping with us, or ever seen
by Sir R. Cotton until, of late, he received it from my Lord of Clare.
For myself, let not God be merciful unto me if, before that time, I ever
saw, heard, or thought of it’ (R. James to Dorchester, vol. 152, § 78).
(R. H.) There is also some further information on the subject in MS.
Harl. 7000, ff. 267, <i>seqq.</i> (B. M.) A considerable number of the letters
of Richard James to Sir Robert Cotton, his friend and benefactor, are
preserved in MS. Harl. 7002. But these throw no satisfactory light
on the incident of 1629. I believe, however, that to an observant reader
they will be likely to suggest the idea that Richard James knew more
than he was willing that Sir Robert should know. The letters are
without dates, after the fashion of the times, and this adds to their
obscurity. But one thing is plain. The writer ran away from London,
either when he knew that the first inquiry was imminent or thought it
probable that a renewed inquiry would be set on foot. In one of these
letters, after many professions of attachment, he writes thus: ‘From
you, at this time, I should not have parted, <i>if the exigence and penurie of
my life had not forc’d a silent retreat into myself, and my owne home at
Corpus Christi College</i>;’ and then, a fit of poesy—such as it was—coming
over him, he ends his letter metrically, as thus:</p>

be printed. But the reduced limits of my book (as compared with
its plan) have compelled the omission of much illustrative matter
which had been carefully prepared for insertion, and which, as I
hope, would have been found to merit the attention of the reader.
I will find room, however, to mention one little fact connected with
the famous Evangeliary marked ‘Nero D. vi.’ The reader probably
remembers Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> fruitless perambulation of the
aisle of Westminster Abbey, with that splendid MS. in his hands, on
the day of the Coronation of Charles the First. It seems likely that the
anecdote was told to Charles the Second when, at length, a like ceremony
was to take place for him. Be that as it may, he sent—before he
had been many days in England—a confidential servant to borrow the
book from Sir Thomas. And the fact of the loan stands recorded on a
fly-leaf, by the King’s intermediary, in honour ‘of the most noble Sir
Thomas <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, the starre of learning and honestie.’ The MS., I may
add, is one of those which came to Sir Robert from Dethick (Garter).
It bears Dethick’s autograph with the date ‘1603’ and Cotton’s, ‘1608.’
Besides the Four Gospels it contains <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Processus factus ad Coronationem
Regis Ricardi Secundi</i>, and <i>Modus tenendi Parliamentum</i></span>. For some
momentary fancy or other Sir Robert took out of another superb MS.
of his—the <i>Psalter</i> of King Henry the Sixth—a small but beautiful
miniature, and made of it a vignette for this Ethelstan volume. So it
continued to remain for two hundred and forty years, when Sir Frederick
Madden restored the miniature to its more legitimate place (Domitian
A. xvii, fol. 96*.) Had this Nero volume chanced to have been
scrutinized at the moment when it was Sir Robert’s fate to be stigmatized
as ‘an embezzler of records,’ it is very possible that it might have
been called to bear witness for the charge. For it is undeniable that
the ‘<span class='sc'>Ro. Cotton Bruceus</span>’ is written <i>over an erasure</i>. (The signature
occurs on the beautiful dedicatory page—‘<i>Beatissimo Papæ Damaso
Hieronymus</i>.’) But, fortunately, the descent of the book can be traced
clearly.</p>

means, if it be possible, that we may come to the speech of one another;

Those deviles have again been writing letters unto my mother.’ In 1679,
it would seem, the two ardent lovers were kept in a sort of honourable
imprisonment. On <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> coming to Cotton House, in the spring of
that year, an upper servant of the family writes thus to a correspondent:
‘I advised him to call for money; take a coach and go about to take the

<p class='c029'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. I have dwelt, somewhat protractedly, on this one interesting point
in Cotton’s history,—pressing as are the limits prescribed to this volume,—under
the belief that many readers will bear in mind that Sir Robert’s
misfortune beneath the recent disinterment of ambassadorial despatches,
written to foreign courts, is <i>not</i> an exceptional misfortune. Sir Walter
Ralegh has fared still worse, in Mr. Gardiner’s able hands, by being
held up to public scorn as a knavish liar, upon the uncorroborated
testimony of certain avowed and bitter enemies of England. See <i>Prince
Charles and the Spanish Marriage</i> (1869), vol. i, Chaps. 1 and 2, <i>passim</i>.
Readers of the admirable <i>History of England</i> by Mr. Froude—and who
has not read that history?—will easily call to mind several not dissimilar
instances. Nor is it at all surprising that it should be so. The
most warily judicial of intellects can never be quite independent of that
factitious charm which there will always be—over and above the legitimate
charm—in telling an old story from an entirely new point of view.
If, besides the attraction of mere novelty, there should chance to have
been a keen burst of search over a difficult country, before the eager
searcher could succeed in running down his quarry, he would be more
than human if, in the moment of victory, he could weigh and balance
with exact precision the real value of the hard-won spoil. At present,
historians are too keenly chasing after new evidence to be able to estimate
quite fairly its relative importance or net result. The most part
both of writers and of readers are far too busy over newly-discovered
materials to adjust with any approach to impartial fairness the vital
question of comparative credibility. But the time for doing <i>that</i> must
needs come, by and bye. Meanwhile, the fame of not a few of our old
and true worthies will—in all probability—suffer some degree of
momentary eclipse; just as that of Ralegh and Cotton has suffered.</p>

<p class='c029'><a href='#r30'>30</a>. Part of Lord Northampton’s large estates came eventually to Lord
Arundel by bequest. He also inherited Northampton’s house at
Greenwich, and occasionally resided there, until its destruction by fire
in January, 1616. Chamberlain’s account of the incident, given to Sir
Dudley Carleton, is worth quotation for the comment with which it
ends: ‘There fell a great mischance to the Earl of Arundel by the
burning of his house&#160;... at Greenwich, where he lost a great deal of
household stuff and rich furniture; the fury of the fire being such that
nothing could be saved. No doubt the Papists will ascribe and publish
it as a punishment for his deserting or falling from them.’ Ten days
before the fire, Arundel had testified, publicly, his conformity with the
Church of England. But he had shewn long before that his religious
views and convictions differed widely from those in which he had been
brought up.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f31'>
<p class='c029'><a href='#r31'>31</a>. The question was complicated by opposition offered by the Lord
Keeper Williams to the terms in which Lord Arundel’s patent was
originally drawn. The relations between Arundel and Buckingham
were never cordial, and the Lord Keeper seems to have profited by that
circumstance to make his opposition to the pension effectual. It is probable
that he had good grounds for so much of his objection as related
to certain powers proposed to be vested in the Earl Marshal’s court.
But on that point Arundel’s views eventually prevailed—until the time
of the Long Parliament. The Lord Keeper’s letter is printed in <i>Cabala</i>,
p. 285.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f33'>
<p class='c029'><a href='#r33'>33</a>. It has been estimated, on competent evidence, that for every one
thousand pounds which the Earl’s estates in England contributed
towards his personal and household expenditure, in exile, twenty-seven
thousand pounds were so contributed towards the maintenance, in one
form or other, of the royalist cause. Such an estimate can, of course,
only be approximative. But it has obvious significance and value.</p>

<p class='c029'><a href='#r35'>35</a>. In the interval between June, 1707 (after the Union with Scotland),
and February, 1708, the following entries occur in the Council Books:—</p>

<p class='c029'>‘1 July, 1707. The Rt. Hon. Robert Harley, one of Her Majesty’s
principal Secretaries of State, delivered up the old signet of office—which
was thereupon broken before Her Majesty—and received a new
one by the Queen’s command.’ The entry is followed by the note:—‘This
order was thus drawn by Mr. Harley’s particular direction.’
(<i>Register of Privy Council</i>, Anne, vol. iii, p. 395.)</p>

<p class='c029'>‘8 January, 170⅞. The Rt. Hon. R. Harley,&#160;... having this day
presented to Her Majesty in her Privy Council a new signet with supporters,
Her Majesty was pleased to deliver it back to him, whereupon
he returned to Her Majesty the old signet, which was immediately
defaced,’ &amp;c. (Ib., p. 485.)</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f36'>
<p class='c029'><a href='#r36'>36</a>. Swift’s account of their first interview after Harley’s partial recovery
merits quotation:—‘I went in the evening,’ he notes on the 5th of
April, ‘to see Mr. Harley. Mr. Secretary was just going out of the
door, but I made him come back; and there was the old Saturday club,
Lord Keeper [Harcourt], Lord Rivers, Mr. Secretary, Mr. Harley, and
I; the first time since his stabbing. Mr. Secretary went away, but I
stayed till nine, and made Mr. Harley show me his breast and tell
all his story.... I measured and found that the penknife would have
killed him, if it had gone but half the breadth of my thumb-nail
lower; so near was he to death. I was so curious as to ask him what
were his thoughts while they were carrying him home in the chair. He
said he concluded himself a dead man.’—<i>Journal to Stella</i>, as before,
pp. 255, 256.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f37'>
<p class='c029'><a href='#r37'>37</a>. The original letters of the Elector to Harley are in Lansdowne
MS. 1236, ff. 272–294. They range, in date, from 15 December, 1710, to
15 June, 1714. There also are several letters (in autograph) of the
Electress Sophia. The earliest of these bears date 26 May, 1707. The
latest is undated, but was written in May, 1714, very few days before
the writer’s death.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f39'>
<p class='c029'><a href='#r39'>39</a>. Thus, for example, at one stage of the proceedings before the Privy
Council about Barbadoes, we find the Lord Keeper Coventry reporting
to the Board upon an order of reference: ‘I am of opinion that
Barbadoes is not one of the Caribbee Islands.... But&#160;... I am
also of opinion that the proof on Lord Carlisle’s part that Barbadoes
was intended to be passed in his Patent is very strong.’—<i>Colonial
Papers</i>, April 18, 1629, vol. v, § 11. See also The King to Wolverton,
<i>Ib.</i>, § 13.</p>

Stanhope of Harrington, and died without issue. Sir William Courten

<p class='c029'><a href='#r42'>42</a>. After elaborate inquiries in the Admiralty Court the losses were

<div class='footnote' id='f44'>
<p class='c029'><a href='#r44'>44</a>. This allusion I am unable to explain. It is quite an exceptional
phrase in the Courten correspondence. But, possibly, ‘station’ may be
understood as meaning merely place of residence.</p>

<p class='c029'><a href='#r46'>46</a>. The fact is unquestionably so, although upon his tomb it is said
that his age was sixty-two years, eleven months, and twenty-eight days.
The same inaccurate statement occurs also—and more than once—in
papers written by Sir Hans Sloane. Courten was born on the 28th
March, 1642. There is an entry of his baptism in the Register of
St. Gabriel, Fenchurch, on the 31st of the same month; and a copy of it
in MS. Sloane, 3515, fol. 53.</p>

<p class='c029'><a href='#r49'>49</a>. Dr. Arthur Charlett’s long and intimate correspondence with Sir
Hans Sloane began in this year (1696), and continued without interruption
until 1720. It has much interest, and fills MS. Sloane 4040,
from f. 193 to f. 285. That with John Chamberlayne was of nearly equal
duration, and is preserved in the same volume (ff. 100–167). The correspondence
with James Bobart contains much valuable material for the
history of botanical study in England, and is preserved in MS. Sloane,
4037 (ff. 158–185). It began in 1685, and was continued until Bobart’s
death, in 1716. Still more curious is the correspondence with John
Burnet (1722–1738), who was originally a surgeon in the service of
the East India Company, and afterwards Surgeon to the King of Spain.
Burnet’s letters to Sloane, written from Madrid, contain valuable illustrations
of Spanish society and manners as they were in the first half
of the Eighteenth Century. This correspondence is in MS. Sloane,
4039.</p>

Revolution, was captured by an English ship when on its way to France,
and had been purchased by Lord Elgin at a Custom House sale in

in such matters. When this metope came, after Choiseul’s death, to be
sold at Paris, by auction, the Trustees of the British Museum sent a
commission for its purchase. The commissioner went so far as to offer
a thousand pounds, but was overbidden by the French Government.</p>

passage:—‘Had this powerful engine of influence’ [namely, loss of caste]
‘been employed in favour of pure morality and efficient virtue, the
Hindoos might have been the most virtuous and happy of the human
race. But the ambition of a hierarchy has, as usual, employed it to serve
its own particular interests instead of those of the community in general.... Should
the pious labours of our missionaries succeed in diffusing
among them a more pure and more moral, but less uniform and less
energetic system of religion, they may improve and exalt the character
of individual men, but they will for ever destroy the repose and tranquillity
of the mass.... The prevalence of European religion will
be the fall of European domination.... The incarnations which
form the principal subject of sculpture in all the temples of India, Tibet,
Tartary, and China, are, above all others, calculated to call forth the
ideal perfections of the art, by expanding and exalting the imagination
of the artist, and exciting his ambition to surpass the simple imitation
of ordinary forms, in order to produce a model of excellence, worthy to
be the corporeal habitation of the Deity. But this no nation of the
East, nor indeed of the Earth, except the Greeks and those who copied
them, ever attempted.’—<i>Analytical Inquiry</i>, &amp;c., p. 80.]</p>
